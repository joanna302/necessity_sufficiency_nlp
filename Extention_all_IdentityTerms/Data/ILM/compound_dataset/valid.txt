`  == question about number of edits ==  hello, since the welcome message to my talk page came from you, i presume you're the person i should turn to with any questions.  i notice that every time anyone makes a change in an article, the old and new versions are stored in the history page.  i'm not terribly computer literate, but it seems that that would take up a lot of space, and i presume wikipedia doesn't have infinite webspace.  if i see an incorrect comma in the third paragraph, a spelling error in the fifth, an incorrect link in the sixth, an incorrect date in the eighth, and unclear wording in the thirteenth, does wikipedia prefer that i do one big edit so that it will have only one new page to store, or is it okay to save as i go along?  are the individual versions in the history page deleted after a certain length of time?  i've been editing my user page, and just wonder whether i should leave changes until i have something big to change.  thanks     : (butting in here, again, as people ask more interesting questions on mel's talk page than on mine).  ann, firstly, diskspace is so incredibly cheap that you could type flat out for your whole life and you wouldn't fill a drive that cost 100 euros;  so don't worry about diskspace.  this issue of what to do in an individual edit is one purely for the convenience of other people who are reading it.  so if you're doing a bunch of fairly trivial tweaks (fixing grammar, spelling, formatting, etc) then do all of those in one go (and give an edit summary like ``various grammar and spelling tweaks``.  if the article needs tweaks and also need a higher-level change (adding or removing a big chunk of text, fixing some wording that you thing is seriously incorrect or misreading) then do the trivial fixes in one edit, and the other fix in another (with an edit summary like ``removing nonsense about father dougal``).  so (in summary) make changes based on what is a logical unit, not what's convenient for the software.    |    (thanks for this; i've copied it to ann heghan's talk page)    `

`  == re: john von neumann ==  it does not fit in with other articles in this category: 3d life, block cellular automaton, cellular automaton, cellular image processing, codd's cellular automaton, conway's game of life, day & night, to name but a few. generally speaking, the ca category appears to be divided between examples of cellular automata (immigration (ca), quadlife, rule 110 cellular automaton) and terms related to cellular automata (garden of eden pattern, gun (ca), oscillator (ca)) - to such an extent that it might be best to divide this category into two subcategories. what you don't find in this category, however, are people who have contributed to cellular automata, regardless of their distinction. what we can do, however - i'll be glad to contribute, and it'd be nice if you helped to - is possibly create a subcategory, ``scientists who have made a major contribution to cellular automata`` (or, for preference, a shorter name, if you can come up with one), and in this category place mr von neumann. tell me what you think. —   `

  == anti-punk ignorant ==  the above user who commented that a user who removed info regarding the punk rock article is absolutely misguided. that user is me. i never once posted that alternative rock did not come from punk. i suggest that you get your facts straight. what i said was, grunge is not punk. i have been a hard core punk and a neo-punk since 1979. since the early '90's, i've been involved in trying to revive punk during the grunge period of the 90's decade (while separating ir from influences of grunge).   i will be blunt and unapologetic again... punk is not grunge. never has been and never will be. obviously from your answer, you do not know anything about punk, its fashion, history, or its influences. punk is a genre in and of itself. it didn't spring from anything known at the time it was born; it obviously didn't come from disco and it certainly was not influenced by hippy music. i should know, since i have almost 30 years experience as a punk, have conversed with the inner circle of the punk greats, and even made recommendations to them in the early 80's.   this anti-punk clown therefore clearly does not know what he is talking about. he doesn't know anything even remotely relating to punk. he accused me of stating that punk did not come from alternative music. to correct you, i stated that punk is not grunge. don't make this same mistake again because it demonstates your low level of knowledge in this area and hugely dents your credibility. this shows that you do not like punk for some personal reason which wiki and i find very disturbing. calm down. you are not correct in your statements.

`  when i said ``yobmod came, he saw, he fucked up this article`` this was because i was extremely pissed off at yobmod's constant deletion of links to actual themes used in science fiction and giving rules for the page which makes finding themes that can be used on the article more harder then a pet owner's decision to put down their beloved animal (we had to use themes that were used in science fiction, they couldn't be used in any other genre, they had to appear in more then one franchise and we couldn't use several dozen tv shows as citations). although what you did to the home and away character articles you'd probably agree with him. it's obvious that user who found a citation to willow being produced by imagine entertainment is a sockpuppet of gabrielkat, and his/her edit to my discussion page really annoyed me. anyhoo, yes i do agree to behave in a more civilised manner, like i was before, but even civilised people react so uncivilised if they are constantly annoyed by someone.   `

  give one example of how i've been rude. i just wanted to talk to user:jimbo wales and if i have been rude to any other user, its because they all wanted their say and i didn't see the point of it. i am also quite sure that mr wales can spare a bit of his time to reply, but i don't mind too much if he doesn't. i just wanted his esteemed opinion. (  )  you say i've made rude comments to other editors. well maybe they shouldn't go on my talk page, if they are so offended by my opinion. (  )

  ==user:acuman== this user should be banned. he has made derogatory comments, intentional fabricated controversial and untrue material into articles, and deliberately disturbed both order and balance in the wiki-community. he has been in numerous exchanges with other users. user:acuman also applies double standards he says one thing for others and sees himself above what he demands and ascribes to other editors. he has upset the following articles in a long list of articles tied to iran; kurds, kurdistan, persian gulf, persians, iran, iranian peoples. the editors he has allies himself with are also irrational and uncompromising racists or bigots. i demand he be disciplined. i have seen the list of controversial and flat our provocative edits and fictional claims he has made and ask that  he be closely watched by administrators, all editors, and the whole community. he has acted in a distasteful manner and has not respected the rules and demands of the community. i am sorry about losing my cool but what he did was amoral and in my opinion amoral

  : some ten seats were created in 1978, during the carter administration.  (this is why carter, who had only a single term, appointed 15 judges while reagan only appointed 10 in his two terms.) many of carter's appointees then left office during the clinton administration. (note that this may not necessarily indicate intent on the carter judges' part: the judges seem to have left the bench after about 18 years on average, and 18 years is a decent run for a federal judge.)  : —

`   fine, gentlemen, but as it appears it's only ourselves having this ``discussion``, allow me to submit this for your inspection, as sent by turner may 19 to all media, the tps and its board (blocked by the latter two) and yes,  fantino himself, in response to the latest headlines. if you ever change your minds...   original to leo kinahan, counsel for sgt. jim cassells  mr. kinahan:  having discovered how sensitive you are about your e-mail address, note that i have included you as a bcc to protect your privacy. as i have been battling with the media ever since my saga began, i am only including them, at this time, in the hope that - considering the recent brave actions of your client and the resultant headlines which have followed - they may, finally, be forced to recognize my plight and resultant complaint since it all began.  as briefly as i can describe it, i was set up by 55 division in november of ' 98 with a manufactured charge of criminal harassment as a favour to their local coffee hangout in my then-neighbourhood, to obviate potential civil litigation i had against it and the parent chain, second cup ltd..come trial the following year and representing myself, i went to court with 39 witnesses, several exculpatory documents and more.   as a result of my actions and an airtight defence, the ``complainant`` - who had been sexually servicing at least one 55 cop (john maciek) - and two of my defence witnesses associated with the coffee franchise were paid to, respectively, take and avoid the stand.  when this was articulated by myself, the original two arresting officers, paul scudds (immediately afterwards appointed by fantino to internal affairs, itself) and sheila richardson, attempted to smash through my door without cause or warrant, causing me to secure counsel, ostensibly for my own protection, in the person of lorne honickman.  where i lose all of the media, in their zeal to protect one of their peers, is the fact that honickman took a bribe from second cup ceo  michael  bregman to throw the trial and protect their ``good name``, which resulted in his: excluding every one of my witnesses; ordering transcripts to be altered by a ministry of the a.g. court reporter - who then bailed on both her employer and her apartment and went into hiding, along with her sister/fellow a.g. employee, who resided elsewhere; refusing to admit documents and evidence to prove my innocence and more.  after dismissing honickman - but still having to return to court to continue the trial - i received a phone call, at home, on friday, january 7, 2000, from 55's john graham, informing me that i would not make it to college park alive with the evidence of all that i put before you now.  thirty-six hours later, just after 10:00 a.m. on january 9, the threat was made good when a dozen cops from the division assembled themselves outside my door - armed with billy clubs, black leather ``beater`` gloves and cell phones - with the stated intention (taped phone messages retrieved after my too-narrow escape) of killing me.  since then, i have run the entire gamut of the complaint system, including three cops i was publicly handed to by fantino at his precious ``town hall`` meetings: stu eley, wayne cotgreave and mike trimble ( stu.eley[USER].on.ca, wayne.cotgreave[USER].on.ca,  mike.trimble[USER].on.ca).  prior to - and after - this, upon my own initiative, were bryce evans (bryce.evans[USER].on.ca), dave mcleod (dave.mcleod[USER].on.ca) and steven pipe (steven.pipe[USER].on.ca); all of whom have had the displeasure - or more, the sadistic pleasure - of dealing with/blowing me off - and who disappeared behind voice mail forever after, as did the others, plus every one of the usual suspects in pro standards ( jane.wilcox[USER].on.ca, john.knaap[USER].on.ca,  rick.gauthier[USER].on.ca)  that i was referred to and others, including scott gilbert of 55 division     (scott.gilbert[USER].on.ca), whom i was forced to cooperate with by the occops and provided a gruelling, eight hour video taped statement, only to have same outright ignored - and my complaint dismissed - by the latter.  during your client's original investigation, i actually contacted  rcmp supt. john neily and asked him to include my situation in the mix, as fantino was bleating about rooting out ``perjury and corruption`` (i was subject to both during my trial) and we cooperatively communicated for eighteen months, only to have - come the moment of truth -  neily regretfully inform me that he'd been ordered to drop my case.  now, if you'll allow me to quote from the most recent media reports...   ``yesterday, at the regular monthly meeting of the police services board, blair and board chair alok muk


` ==response== :i am pleased if you've been taken aback, i wish i still had that e-mail from slim virgin, being ``taken aback`` from your actions in regards to her feelings on that matter would be an understatement. she almost left the project because of you. i wonder how many others you've made feel that way.  as for the comment in regards to collaboration, i suggest you give it a shot in this case, if the aborted arbcom case against me showed anything, it's that i'm more than willing to compromise, if people give me one, but i will never betray my beliefs in response to ochlocratic or aristocratic pressure. once the things on my manifesto, fairly simple requests really(equity, clarity, etc.), are met, i'll be more than happy to change the signature. until then, welcoming is the perfect forum since these newbies are the most vulnerable to the contreversy you speak of, the joeyramoney affair showed us that nobody is safe from that toxic atmosphere and it must be changed one way or another.a ''''''  ::i consider your second comment to be an insult against the intelligence of newbies, and part of the problem i see and i'm trying to help fix here. the line between ``official`` and ``personal`` has been so blurred that it no longer exists, if you are in a certain group, the two are interchangable at will and those people can use the word ``consensus`` to try and dissaude anyone who has an opinion contrary to their own. a '''''' `

i have a cripplingly low amount of self-esteem and confidence. my mind is consumed with self-loathing, and no matter how much me or the people around me try to logically get it out of me, it doesn't get out.      i think a huge part of this is the fact that since 14 years old, i've been a regular daily reader/poster on subs like foreveralone or places like r9k. i can't get any of this shit out of my head anymore. i can never feel comfortable in my skin. i live constantly on alert mode, there is always the loud voice that is telling me i'm not good enough like the others.      simply put, no matter how much everyone tells me it's bs, the posts telling me i'm too short, too beta, too autistic or whatever the fuck are forever ingrained in my mind and they can never escape.      i don't remember the last time i genuinely fully enjoyed myself. even in the moments where i have the heartiest laughs, it all feels fake, and there's always that feeling in the gut that never goes away.

`   === another policy === (moved from personal talk page) :there is also another policy here: its called consensus, which holds precedence over being bold (the latter of which is a guideline, and thus not canonical). consensus for this article is to not refer to badvista, and discuss any such changes before making it live (i already said, the discussions in this effect can be found in talk pages).   :btw, i am preserving the original state of the article, nor ``making them without discussion``. propose your concerns, and let others comment. this is how such articles are handled. each party has to accept the majority decision.  :btw, you are not supposed to edit archive pages.  comments should go to the talk page. and removing comments from user talk pages without a pointer to where it is also frowned on. btw, sorry for coming of as bitey, that wasn't my intention.  :: i haven't removed any comment from this page. if i don't edit the page, how can i add new comments?    :i suggest again, you propose the changes in the talk page, and let others respond. my comments are already there. the ball now lies with the community, and not either you or me.     ::sorry, didn't notice you already did.      i find it very confusing as i read more.   keep saying we need to propose changes in the talk page before we can edit it. however first i saw you don't discuss before you revert changes. second i found that you didn't discuss every time before you edit pages or add new contents by viewing your own edit history, so it appears you are asking someone to follow some ``rules`` which you don't follow either. you are setting a bad example since you are an admin. after all no page saying we have to discuss pages before we can edit. please point it out if i'm wrong since i have no time reading all minor policies and rules in wikipeida.   if  is right about what it says, i could say wikipedia gives you a false impression that anyone can contribute the article freely, as long as you are acting in good faith. try to read wp:bold or wikipedia does not have firm rules. the reality clearly tells you the other way round.  wikipedia:ignore_all_rules states that it is an official policy. it reads:  then could anyone try me why i received a serious warning from  said you must follow this and that or you will be banned? i don't think i have violated any major policy or i am deserved to be banned (eg vandalism). is it enough to issue a ban simply because you don't know ``badvista.org is a bad source as the admin claims``   this further proves the so-called official policy above is non-existent. from the sound of it, the admin has been closing all room for argument once it is decided. it doesn't really allow you to ignore a rule in reality, no matter how sound you are. let's say i think we should present all popular claims  (badvista.org is one of them) because we shouldn't filter on behalf of the readers. we should present both sides of the arguments and let the readers should judge by themselves. of course i can't choose to ignore even if the official policy grant me to do so. admin is always above the policy.    on 14 oct 2007, the page was locked up because ``i made some bad edit`` according to what  said. i assume a lock up is not a decision made so lightly. as a matter of fact, i couldn't edit it anymore.   in reality the admin essentially  controlled everything. although there are official policies in place, i seriously doubt whether admins will obey it. as a matter of fact, he once reverted all my contributions. of course he offered no reasons when he first did it, clearly against the revert policy which said you should explain to the contributor before you revert.   {{cquote|act in good faith, and assume good faith on the part of ot

  ==hey sue, how are u. from u know who==  hey sue anne, how are you?  hope you are as fine as always.  looks like the petty cabal has been upto something on my ip userpage. lol.  some of the cabal must have jumped in, looking at the edit history, maybe because they were smarting when i pointed out their ways. lol. i feel bad for them, they must have been nursing their grudges for long. lol.  your message in my support and other messages have been deviously deleted by one of the cabal. lol. would you be bothered enough to put it in place again? the cabal obviously want to paint the issue their way. hahahahaha.  i did not read a single message on my usertalk page after your nice supportive message because i already knew it must be full of the cabal's unmentionable things. lol. i only noted the names of the cabal and had a big laugh.  a few things did come out of the incident.  crossmr meekly submitted that he had not blocked me. he further admitted in so many of his own words that he had not even read the message vesther had sent me to which i had replied, and that he had no idea about the issue, but he still sent me 1 warning and 1 message, lol. even after warning me and sending me another message, he did not have any idea about the issue and had not read about the issue at all!!! lol. he further did not even warn vesther, but he warned me for using those words, vesthers words, which i only used to reply to him in his own medicine.!!! lol.  so, the result is that crossmr has succeeded in showing himself to be unfair, biased and grossly incompetent to be an admin. who makes these guys admins??? lol.  as for mr. royboy, lol. the less said about him the better. lol. hahahahaha. who made this guy admin? where did he come from? who is he? what explanation did he give for blocking at that particular time? me and crossmr were just talking about his warning, which u know by now was totally wrong and biased, he was not even aware of the issue and gave an excuse of tralala, which vesther had used!!!, and this guy turns up from nowhere? it was a total and absolute disgraceful abuse of admin priveleges. too bad i foiled it. i guess he only knows how to block people without reading a single word of what people write or even understanding the issue. i sympathize with his condition.  some people do get obsessed and have control issues with wiki i guess, vesther being a case in point. is it possible that this guys a friend or a sock-puppet of an earlier aggrieved cabal member? lol.  anyway, the above two examples are on record, and you are the witness!!!  and i hope next time you act strongly and correctively on such issues, i mean un-blocking.  i guess this petty cabal must have been going about this, just block, without any warning to block, and without understanding or reading anything about it, with other people, before they came across someone like me, lol. and after that they try and make excuses and dig up old irrelevant issues which they couldnt muster up before that, as excuses. they must be quite experienced in trying to obfuscate the specific issue in question later on. lol.  i sincerely think that you should have exercised your right to unblock, seeing how u understood the issue, and the concerned admin or admins had no expanation for the block.  no reading, no understanding of the specific issue, no warning to the original guilty party, no warning to block, just block!!!! lol.  but now, they will think hard before going on about their murky ways. lol.  so, by extrapolating this, i have come to the conclusion that wiki is seriously and morally challenged and also lacks in competence. lol.  all the more reason its needs me. lol.  i wont let you down wiki. lol.  of course, there must be many good decent admins like you.  a few words about my messages i had sent.  with regard to vesther, we both know what i feel about him. hahahahaha. lol. but to be fair, its not his fault really. its the incompetent power-mad admin's fault who probably hit buttons from a list before even reading the messages of both parties. lol.  vesther just couldnt take it i guess after i repied back, giving him some of his own medicine, he just started crying. lol. i guess he's not used to it. maybe till now people just got bored of his obsessive ways and ignored him. lol. too bad. i see he has been receiving some much needed counselling from his best friend crossmr who did not give him a warning for the very same words. hahahahahahahaha.  and he has further archived the discussions. hmmmmm. not a bad idea, when do u think i should archive that now-useless page, as it is

cope or not that shit is unabashedly degenerate


not orignial research, there exists a huge literature. mmx, there were 3 symmetrical collapses on 9/11, not one. and of course there have been many dozens, if not hundreds of symmetrical building collapses outside 9/11, all of them due to controlled demolition.  there are zero examples of symmetrical collapse from fires, impact damage, or anything besides contolled demolition.  achieving symmetry in a building collapse requires that all of the vertical supports fail at the same time, or a least fail in an evenly spaced, symmetrical manner. the odds of this happening by chance are very small, especially considering the impact damage and fires were asymmetrical. for it to happen three times in one day is profoundly significant, statistically speaking.    


there's a quote from an earlier game that i really like that goes something like: "strong pokemon, weak pokemon, that's only our selfish perceptions. truly skilled trainers should fight with their favorites." and tbh i feel like that's what the pokémon games should be about, at least at a casual level. meta? never heard of her. i'm fighting the elite 4 with a team of all cat pokemon and you cannot stop me.

  ==depolarization== when looking at the page depolarization it says that depolarization is only when voltage is heading towards zero volts and never when it is not. so once it crosses zero volts it is actually repolarizing. i'm not an expert on this but there is a very long discussion on it in the site i mentioned, it definitetly needs to be fixed.

water is densest at 4 degrees celsius, but it’s not that much denser than water at other temperatures. exploiting tiny differences in the density of water of different temperatures would be a very inefficient way of producing power.  the only ways i know of that produce significant amounts of power from cold water are hydroelectric power (dams), tidal power, wave power, and power from ocean currents (analogous to wind power). each of these involves falling water or water that is moving somewhat rapidly.

`  i don't know what you consider ``useful`` information barto, but someone here can't even get the birthdate and death date correct.  i am posting here as someone who has known mr. gostick for over 30 years. mr. gostick was not a ``white supremacist``that i can assure you of; though people who did  not like his stand for ``freedom of speech, research`` etc., particularly when it interfered with their plans to stifle just such things were apt to distort and call him any name they desired by way of smearing.  i have never heard even the bad press call him a ``white supremacist``-extreme rightwing, hatemonger, anti-semite and other bogeymen namesyes.  these would again be stupid name calling without any legitmate application in their use.    so how is ``white supremacist`` npov and ``canadian patriot`` not?!  i think it's a matter of false perspective.  btwthere is a link to david lethbrigde, who was nothing but a jewish-marxist ``professor``, who misled a gang of youths in disrupting meetings of lawfully abiding citizens using their right to free speechmooning an assembly of mature people is being a ``professor`` worthy of even the slightest consideration here!!!  the link to anti-semitic, which i find to be an absurd page in the first place is just another smear tactic (used by left-to-right so-called) to quell the right to question and discuss anything that has to do with things ``jewish``, zionist, israeli by labelling people as if they were the devil themselves. i personally know of many jews who stood by his stance on freedom of speech and any published articles on the exploits of zionism and it's new world order machinations.  i will correct the dates for his birth and death among other re-edits. skull`

[URL] this website lists many sources that verify his claims and they are still being denied. for example, a prior discussion: the whole story of frank dux and the kumite is a fraud. there is no such thing as the ``kumite`` tournament.  does anyone honestly believe that such a world class underground full contact tournament could have gone on, and there would remain no evidence of it beside dux's testimony? anyone who could produce evidence of such a thing would have a million dollar story, but no one has. wouldn't someone eventually come forward, or one or two fighters maybe speak out against it? what about the families of the fighters? wouldn't they notice that their loved ones come home with broken bones and missing teeth? dux himself claims that there were fatalities. in that case wouldn't the families of the dead fighters investigate what happened? dux further claims that there were spectators gambling in the event (as in the movie), then how could they keep the silence of the spectators for all these years? to this day there remains no video, or pictures or anything to substantiate dux's claims.  dux further claims that he holds the record for the fastest ``kick with a knockout`` at 72 mph. this makes no sense whatsoever. is there a cop with a radar gun next to ring, measuring the speed of every strike? a 72 mph kick seems impossible, as swords don't even swing that fast. someone wouldn't just ``jump into`` such an event either, but they would have training partners, and a record of their fighting career. they would have won tournaments, and fought in other full-contact venues (like ones that actually exist), yet their is no footage or evidence of dux's participation in such events. he is a martial artist, but nothing like he claims.  the only thing that's been knocked out here is dux's credibility. soldier of fortune magazine exposed his lies about his military career. using the freedom of information act they showed that the actual years of his service in the military don't match up with his claims. he could have never served in vietnam, and was never a special op like he claims. they exposed a picture of him in the military as a hoax, by showing that the ribbons and medals on his uniform are inconsistent with his branch of service. his own response to this is that the uniform was a costume that he was wearing on the way to a halloween party. you gotta be kidding me. dux sued them for libel and lost.  he also sued jean claude van damme, saying that he (dux) had come up with the story for the movie ``the quest``, and that van damme had made a contract with him for royalties that were never paid. dux failed to produce any evidence of such a contract, and claimed that the missing evidence was destroyed in an earthquake. van damme's lawyer ripped dux's credibility to shreds, showing that dux's apartment was not damaged like he said it was,

`  == wrestlecrap ==  just wanted to give you a heads up. the edit you made to wrestlecrap that you stated was ``reverting vandalism`` was actually putting vandalism back onto the page. i would've assumed you were vandalizing the page yourself until i noticed your other contributions and saw that you revert a lot of vandalism elsewhere. that's when i realized it was probably a misunderstanding so i decided to message you and let you know. a few of us have been having a really hard time with several vandals who keep re-registering after getting banned, so if you could keep a lookout it would be a big help to us. thanks  `


  == parentacide ==  parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.  parentacide dates back to greek mythology, where oedipus killed his father laius and married his mother jocasta. frued coined the term oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.  in 1989 lyle and erik menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.  jeremy bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. being adopted, bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.

   == the language of the theme song of gladiator ==   most people believe that the language of the gladiator theme song by lisa gerrard is latin. however i have also heard that the language used by lisa gerrard for this song was one that she had made up herself and used this language only in a spiritual way (praying to god). does anyone know for sure which language this song is written in?

`  i have no desire to belong to bin laden's group, only to create factually correct articles. if we created an article incorporating the world islamic front (wif) with the larger organization created by the wif through their jihad against zionists and crusaders fatwa, it would incorrectly identify members of the larger organization as being strictly islamic. nowhere in the jihad against zionists and crusaders fatwa, does the wif limit the membership of the organization to muslim. in his video and audio addresses, bin ladin often refers to the international front for jihad against the zionists and crusaders (ifjzc) as a multi-cultural organization or movement concerned primarily with doing what is right for all people by objecting to the special interests of zionists and crusaders. he regularly appeals to americans to join the ifjzc to fight ``tyranny and suppression of freedom to [our] own country, ...the patriot act under the disguise of fighting terrorism.``  `

`: dear zayd, what ``salafi`` advocate and what they practice are two different things.  my mother's family ranges from barelwi to tafdheelies and shias.  my father's family ranges from barelwi's to deobandies and salafies.  what sickens me is the will of a salafi to kill in cold blood what he considers a ``biddati``, ``mushrik``, ``kafir``, ``qabar parast`` etc.  recently allama hassan turabi, a shia scholar who did much for peace between shias and sunnies, was killed by an 18 year old suicide bomber who was a student in a salafi madrassa.  before that a couple of suicide bombers killed 72 barelwies during their maghrib prayers.  their fault?  they were celebrating the prophet muhammed's birthday which seems a sin punishable by death.  before that, a couple of suicide bombers blew scores of visitors to the shrine of bari imam who is revered by both shias and sunnies.  their sin?  they were reading holy quran for the soul of the saint.  in all three incidents the victims were non militants and many were women and children.  i can not tell you how sick i felt when i saw the salafi's joy on the death of all those ``kuffars``.  may allah send all those sickos to hell with their suicide bombers and the saudi fianciers   `

`ekantik, do you believe that sathya sai baba can miraculously transform his genitals? i would appreciate an answer.  i also find it amusing that ekantik, of all people, is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by sai devotees when ekantik is a hare krishna congregational member and a gaudiya vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that lord krishna literally manifested 16,000 seperate human forms, married 16,000 seperate women, copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. sanjay also believes that lord krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the lord vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (mohini devi). so it appears that ekantik and sai devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. i can't help to wonder why ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.  funny how ekantik and andries (critics of sathya sai baba) want to promote ``well sourced`` stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference (written by a doctor in a well known sri lankan newspaper) is not ``well sourced``. this whole thing is pov and the attempt to skew the article with a pov is evidenced by these discussions. good luck wikisunn. you see what you are up against?  -email   `

`  == tags ==  back on february 23, you made some hefty edits to the santa claus in northern american culture article.  in captioning some images, you used a few pairs of  tags (which in itself didn't affect the size of the text within the captions), but you didn't properly close the tags, so all the text afterwards was made to be really tiny.  when you use a tag, you have to close it by typing a slash into the tag, like this:   i don't know why nobody noticed that the article was messed up until at least three months later, but i've taken care of it.  also, while i'm at it, when i saw who had made the edit, i was slightly concerned to see the ``bot`` part of your username—it made me worry that someone had programmed a bot to make edits, but that the person hadn't programmed the bot to correctly close tags.  i see now that this isn't the case, but have you considered getting your username changed so that you don't cause people to think you're a bot?   `


`  == inheiritance ==  i think there should be 4 inheiritance books because in the third eragon gets married and  gets a new blue sword and then he finishes his training and him and roran should save katrina. then roran and katrina also get married. then roran gets the yellow dragon egg and names him katrinak. then eragon trains roran and one day roran's yellow enchanted sword slid and sliced his stomach open eragon heals it as much as he could but it leaves a scar like eragon had from durza then they gather the dragons that give roran ``the gift of the dragons`` then roran transformed into an elf. roran and eragon both had children then saphira and katrinak mated then there were 10 dragon eggs that were given to their children and those eggs had hatched then eragon and roran train them`

>and therefore presumably worse situation **for** the insensitive one      everyone perceives the world and life subjectively, that's just how it is, that's how we have to get through life. it can be a good thing and a bad thing, and for people who are sensitive, for one, things might feel bad quicker than for others. but that doesn't mean that the pain they're suffering is less "bad" for them - as you said. because that's how they perceive and feel it, so that's absolute reality for them, even if objectively the issue isn't as bad. they still have to live through it. they have to go through the exact pain someone less sensitive would have to go through because of an objectively worse issue. (most?) people experience life subjectively. the limit to feeling a certain amount of pain for someone sensitive might be lower than for someone less sensitive. but it doesn't mean it's less real, it doesn't mean they're in need of less support and understanding and empathy. it's the same, felt, pain. often, a sensitive person will feel happiness quicker and easier too. does that mean they are, really, less happy than a less sensitive person?       but this was just a rant and i'm sorry if i misunderstood your comment.

  == apologies ==  ::apologies. i wouldn't touch those pages on principle. i know a good editor, hotheaded, is on the block for the nth time. it is becoming a hobby in here. he seems the most watched man in the i/p area. every misstep, slip of language, loss of patience, is summarily run into an/i to make his indictment sheet belie the fact that many editors, on both sides, have found his work, on things like small towns, coordinates, etc., invaluable, and his assistence generous. he's careless on etiquette and form, and careful about useful edits on good pages. he hates bad work, and lets it run to his head. i put that note in quite aware he'll be booted up the arse once again, and dropped a note on his page to that effect. a pity. had i the extreme interest in and knowledge of ther niceties of hauling anyone over the coals for policy infractions, i could spend most of my wiki time hauling people into these forums. still, as ashley knows, policy is policy, and trumps all. that's the nature of admin, and that's how wiki works. regards

  :i don't think it's an exception, when claiming united macedonia, they usually just refer to aegean, vardar and pirin macedonia (the parts in greece and serbia are just included in the terms aegean and vardar macedonia respectively). as long as this article says (in the note at the top) that it's about the term, the profile of greek macedonia really has no place here.

`  :you'll just have to forgive me if i take a timeout for a kafka moment. from ``before the law``: :before the law stands a doorkeeper. to this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country and prays for admittance to the law. but the doorkeeper says that he cannot grant admittance at the moment. the man thinks it over and then asks if he will be allowed in later. ``it is possible,`` says the doorkeeper, ``but not at the moment.`` since the gate stands open, as usual, and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man stoops to peer through the gateway into the interior. observing that, the doorkeeper laughs and says: ``if you are so drawn to it, 'just try to go in despite my veto. but take note: i am powerful. and i am only the least of the doorkeepers. from hall to hall there is one doorkeeper after another, each more powerful than the last. the third doorkeeper is already so terrible that even i cannot bear to look at him.`` these are difficulties the man from the country has not expected; the law, he thinks, should surely be accessible at all times and to everyone, but as he now takes a closer look at the doorkeeper in his fur coat, with his big sharp nose and long, thin, black tartar beard, he decides that it is better to wait until he gets permission to enter. the doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at one side of the door. there he sits for days and years. he makes many attempts to be admitted, and wearies the doorkeeper by his importunity. the doorkeeper frequently has little interviews with him, asking him questions about his home and many other things, but the questions are put indifferently, as great lords put them, and always finish with the statement that he cannot be let in yet. the man, who has furnished himself with many things for his journey, sacrifices all he has, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. the doorkeeper accepts everything, but always with the remark: ``i am only taking it to keep you from thinking you have omitted anything.`` during these many years the man fixes his attention almost continuously on the doorkeeper. he forgets the other doorkeepers, and this first one seems to him the sole obstacle preventing access to the law. he curses his bad luck, in his early years boldly and loudly; later, as he grows old, he only grumbles to himself. he becomes childish, and since in his yearlong contemplation of the doorkeeper he has come to know even the fleas in his fur collar, he begs the fleas as well to help him and to change the doorkeeper's mind. at length his eyesight begins to fail, and he does not know whether the world is really darker or whether his eyes are only deceiving him. yet in his darkness he is now aware of a radiance that streams inextinguishably from the gateway of the law. now he has not very long to live. before he dies, all his experiences in these long years gather themselves in his head to one point, a question he has not yet asked the doorkeeper. he waves him nearer, since he can no longer raise his stiffening body. the doorkeeper has to bend low toward him, for the difference in height between them has altered much to the man's disadvantage. ``what do you want to know now?`` asks the doorkeeper; ``you are insatiable.`` ``everyone strives to reach the law,`` says the man, ``so how does it happen that for all these many years no one but myself has ever begged for admittance?`` the doorkeeper recognizes that the man has reached his end, and, to let his failing senses catch the words, roars in his ear: ``no one else could ever be admitted here, since this gate was made only for you. i am now going to shut it.`` : `

  :this is ridiculous; such a condition does not exist according to any policies or guidelines. it isn't my fault that you can't see the obvious. i haven't seen you blocking grandmaster when he accused azizbekov of being a sock, claiming it’s so obvious in spite of the fact that he has provided no such evidences at all. azizbekov was consequently banned when vartan discovered that he was a genuine user. neither have i seen you block him when antranikpasha was claimed to be a sock, again without any evidences provided. as a consequence, andranik was also banned. i have better things to do than wasting all my time at a time like christmas and the days following to document further something which is so obvious. i also find it weird that all your interventions have always been to support one side against the other as can be confirmed by your edit history.  :accusations without convincing evidences are what should be condemned, like those of grandmaster’s every time a genuine user appears. accusations should exist when we are facing with an obvious sock, which is the case with ehud. and i will not be waiting weeks until you read anything at all, this condition is unacceptable. and i will not be contesting my block either. i know it will be plainly rejected or the request being ignored until the block is waved. i don't expect anything anymore. its plain fishy, vartan gets the restriction, i get blocked the next day for ridiculous incidences which is absolutely nothing in comparison with what has happened with atabek.  :it should be obvious that a block is too harsh of a punishment for accusation of sock-puppetry, especially when there is an ample amount of evidence of such sockpuppetry. furthermore, a block should be preceded by an official warning on the user's page, with the clear notice that the user will be blocked next time. a simple request on other pages doesn't satisfy this. and also, just because the administrators have not concluded that a user is a sock-puppet, doesn't mean there is no basis for such sockpuppetry. -

  * actually, the winner of the dallas vs seattle game doesn't automatically play either new orleans or chicago. it's based on both wild card game winners to determine who plays. it's the 3 vs 6 game that is more determined. if the 3 seeds wins, they play new orleans, if the 6 seed wins, they play chicago. based on that, dallas/seattle plays the other team.

this again shows that user charles is stalking me. he keeps this user page in watchlist - and appears here less than two hours after i posted my complaint. if i had been stalking charles in the start of this, i would have seen that he had approached keilana with an accusation against me (and i would have had some possibility to answer before that questionable blocking made by keilana). however, i do not stalk user charles, contrary to what he is doing. i have been reading several times about white rajahs of sarawak - there is my edit in discussion about another white rajah, before user charles appeared to that page. generally, i have some same interest fields, which is why i occasionally edit same articles and participate same discussions. however, in this thing, keilana, very unbecomingly to anything which is needed to be impartial, seems to have chosen her party. (and surely user charles appears soon to stalk me and stalk my comments.)

`  == definition of witchcraft/wicca ==  i have some problems with this section. it's all very nice to be able to laugh and say ``you're wrong on all these points``, but in fact this section is misrepresenting wicca just as much as the harry-haters. *the heading itself seems to imply that witchcraft and wicca are synonymous. wicca is merely one variety of modern witchcraft. *wiccans commune with the dead and the spirit world. at halloween (or samhain), for example, we invite the spirits of our ancestors and deceased loved ones to return and share our warmth and companionship for an evening. extensive spirit contact by wiccans (via ouija board and channeling) is recounted in a voice in the forest by jimahl difiosa, an alexandrian high priest. *sorcery: well, wiccans definitely perform magic. the word 'sorcery' has a sinister sound to it, which perhaps doesn't fit with wicca so well, but if it merely means 'performing magic', then certainly. *occult symbology: this is merely a catch-all phrase for anything that looks a bit 'occult', isn't it? well, wicca is very definitely 'occultism', since it deals with magic and the hidden parts of reality. and yes, wiccans use occult symbols, such as zodiacal signs. *curses are of course forbidden in wicca, as is all malicious or harmful magic. *demon posession: whoever accused wiccans of practicing demon posession is pulling a swift one. wiccans practice what could loosely be called ``posession``: calling our god or goddess into the body of a priest or priestess. i guess this is fairly similar to what christians call ``being filled with the spirit``, but if you happen to consider the wiccan gods to be demons (and of course they're demons, aren't they, since any deity other than jehovah is a demon), then you could term this ``demon possession``, feeling only a tinge of guilt at your verbal chicanery.  the real reason why harry potter has nothing to do with wicca is because harry potter is fantasy, presented in a manner that has virtually no resemblance to the reality of modern witchcraft, whether it be wicca or any other variety. how many kids watch the power rangers and decide they want to enter law enforcement as a ranger when they grow up? the texas rangers, just like the power rangers, wear uniforms, fight bad guys, protect law and order, have headquarters and so on. the parallels are all there, but any rational person will immediately discern the vast differences.  i don't think we need to misrepresent our religion, simply because some people get the flutters whenever the words 'magic' or 'occult' are mentioned. lets show a bit of backbone, rather than trying to turn our faith into what we think christians want it to be!  `

`, 17 august 2006 (utc)joe  re.: rathlin massacre the people on rathlin were not irish- they were the families of sorley boy mcdonnell's followers. the scottish clanchiefs had sent their families to rathlin in the belief that they would be safe there. drake had been hired to supervise the transport of john norri's troops to rathlin, and then patrol the waters between rathlin and the mull of kintyre to prevent the scots from sending reinforcements. john norris had a force of 300 foot and 80 horse as well as siege-guns at his disposal; it seems extremely unlikely that he would have had to rely on drake and the 25-strong crew of the ``falcon``- drake's vessel at the time- to help norris do his dirty-work for him.john sugden's biography of drake contains a fair amount of info on the subject. 21:46`

`  wow, you're hopeless.  lets start with the trifles; you spelled ``necessarily`` wrong.  that doesn't give you much credibility.  the answer to your first question is no, whites from liverpool speak scouse, and they don't speak the same as whites from south london, of course, but i don't see what that has to do with white south african english.  however, the answer to your second question is mostly yes.  most blacks from boston do sound pretty much the same as blacks from new orleans.  most blacks from both areas speak what's called african american vernacular english (of you're into political correctness, which you seem to be), which is an ethnolect and a sociolect that is becoming more and more different from the speech of whites in america.  i'm not exactly sure what you mean by ``mother tongue english speakers``.  do you mean l1 varieties?   i don't think my final statement is a violation of wp:own because i never said i own this article, nor did i ever think that.  i simply temporarily ``took it over``, if you will, to make it a better description of white south african english.  those just happened to be the words i decided to use.  it says at the top of this article that the article was in need of attention by an expert on this subject, and while i am no expert, i certainly seem to be the closest thing to it that this article has ever seen (with the notable exception of jacklumber).  i think you knew what i meant by that expression, but it's certainly possible that you didn't. finally, i will respond to your earlier comment that ``white south african english`` as a title for this article is ``simply racist``.  you really haven't explained to me how that would be a racist title.  i'm going to assume that you meant either: 1.) that title would suggest that only whites in south africa speak english and absolutely no one else does. 2.) that title would suggest that whites are the most important group in south africa, they're are better than everyone else, and they are thus the only group in south africa deserving an article on the type of english they speak.  both of these choices seem rather absurd to me.  if you thought 1.), then i already proposed a solution for that.  we could give each indian south african english, black south african english, and white south african english its own article to show that there are indeed other dialects of english spoken in south africa besides wsafe.  if you thought 2.), then you are racist.  let me explain.  for that title to be racist i would have to be white.  if i were a racist white person i would want that to be the title of the article to show that whites are better and that the way they speak is better.  since we are both anonymous, however, there is no way you could possibly know my race.  you would have to rely on conjecture.  in this case, your guess was that i was white.  after all, if i were black and i proposed that, i would have to somehow be racist against myself.  what i don't understand for sure is why you assumed i was white.  that's quite a racist assumption.  anyone in the world can edit wikipedia; people from all races.  yet you assumed i was white.  unless you had statistics to back that assumption up, which you didn't, then that's ``simply racist``.  even if you did have statistics to back it up, it still could be racist.  to me, what you're saying is that only white people edit wikipedia, and that people of other races aren't intelligent enough.  of course, i don't for sure, but that's my conjecture.   `

`  =sweden==   the legal actions taken by the swedish royal family is according to the article in svd not for his comments about sweden in general, but for his comments about the royal family per se, and then especially his comments about princess madeleine claiming she being indecent.   *out of curiosity - does anyone know what these creatures (i won't have them in the same category as us humans) at wbc make of the united nations? i can imagine they'll hate it, as they seem to hate everything in the universe, but it would be interesting to know...  *i completely agree with the guy above me, but as this is an encyclopedia, why do we have to start an article about a schurch off with ``hate group``?  *perhaps because these are a group of people who rejoyce when thousands of children die in terrible tragedies and come to funerals to yell vial things at the loved ones of the people that fought for their rights. what the hell should we start it off with? this is a local church that has very good after-school programs?   hatred of islam and muslims, however despicable, is not racism, and neither is hatred of catholics or catholicism.  in general the racism section is pretty weak.  there is plenty bad to be said about phelps without bringing the allegation that he uses the word ``nigger.``    nice work.  much better. i removed the npov tag.   this article could be accused of not quite attaining npov, but it is clear that the writers have made an attempt to see this ridiculous crusade from both sides that is nothing short of heroic.  patrick beverley, 15 august 2005  ==former members of westboro baptist church==  the article has been updated with the following:  ``george stutzman, theresa davis, chris davis, karl hockenbarger, bill hockenbarger and his wife, james hockenbarger and joshua phelps-roper are no longer members of the westboro baptist church.``  where did this information come from? the hockenbargers have been members of the church for a long time. i believe chris davis is married to rebekah phelps-davis, one of fred phelps' children. his leaving the church would mean that he and rebekah are no longer together. joshua is one of the children of church spokesperson shirley phelps-roper. his leaving would probably mean that he no longer has a relationship with his parents. (as dorothea bird once said: ``if you're in, you're in. if you're out, you're out.)    ==hate group==  any chance of this article having a further early emphasis on it being a recognised hate group?   ==lies==  the westboro baptist cult disgrace me. they hate catholics because they aparantly abuse children and are homosexuals. this is absolute lies and heavily offensive. the fact that they make up so much lies and how there actions are contradicted within the bible should be given more attention. anyone agree?   ==appearance==  i remember an appearance by a woman and her children on the howard stern show... they were members of the westboro church, and in the few minutes i watched one thing that the woman said struck me as an interesting point: ``i don't hate fags, god hates fags,`` or something to that effect.  and yes, fred phelps mentioned this subject in an april 2003 interview with blacktable.com: (here's the url: -  )  ==article structure== i started some sections to give the article more structure, and made other indicated changes. -   ==comment== on a similar note, should we change references to this group from ``church`` to ``organization?``  i understand the name is westboro baptist church, however for accuracy sake they are not really a ``church.``   ==this church praises dead swedes== a friend gave me this. copy and paste this link in to your webbrowser otherwise it won't work [URL] i don't know of its validity. if somebody want to add this to the article, go ahead. if you can't download the image: it's basically a flier by the church that praises the presumed 2000 deaths of swedes in the recent asian tsunami. as a swedish citizen i find it highly offensive that goes beyond words, so it would be impossible for me to write an  unbiased addition to the article regarding this. thanks,    == ``criticism`` section should be expanded further ==  i added a bit to it 


does this count as [off my meta] if i'm complaining about stuff on this sub?      based on my own personal experience and other posts i've seen, i would argue there is a real problem with people attacking the op for venting views they do not like. i get this isn't a safe space for any specific groups and i'm not saying people can't disagree with what someone is venting about. i've gotten into it quite a bit with some people's venting here, like them hating an entire group of people because of the actions of a few. however, far too often do i notice people resort to personal attacks, aka ad hominem fallacy. not to mention this violates rule 4 of this sub. i suspect the reason this rule is in place is to stop this sort of thing. attack the argument, not the person.      basically, instead of people addressing why they disagree with what someone is venting about, they often try to discredit the person by making claims like "you're not really x" or "you're fake and a troll". that's not to say trolling doesn't happen here, but often, disagreeing with someone's venting is treated as if that person is just trying to get a rise out of people. it's like people refuse to believe someone could have unpopular opinions and stand by them, no, they *must* be trolling. it's very closed minded too, because the person making the troll claim refuses to think outside of their world view. for example, if you're a racial minority, some people have a hard time believing you if you don't fall into stereotypical views for your race. is it so hard to believe someone can have opinions you don't like and that they believe in them? if they really are trolling, you replying to them just fuels their fire. it's so unproductive to vent if all people are going to do is accuse you of being this or not being that, effectively going against the purpose of this sub.      given that the purpose of this sub is to allow opinions and venting that offmychest wouldn't allow, i would expect better of people here. i dare say if you want a sub like this where people get auto banned from posting in specific subs that offmychest mods don't like, that sub is much more of a fit for you than hanging around here trying to dogpile people who go against your world views.      so, disagree with me on this if you must, but i think it would be better to debunk my arguments rather than claim i'm a fake and thus, that alone is somehow supposed to invalidate everything i've written.

`  this has been posted on athaenara's own discussion page in response to a discussion between athaenara and ``sethswirsky`` which appears there.  it's interesting that they felt it better to cozy up there rather than here on the pages directly associated with the article:      it is a complete and utter falsehood that i have sent any e-mails to this ``sethswirsky`` person. i suggest that this is just a member of the ``tribe of seth`` referenced in the article.      as for the actual set swirsky being a democrat, don't make me laugh. the guy is a complete and total devotee of the bush wing of the republican party. as i have suggested, if ``sethswirsky`` is the real seth swirsky, let him submit a blog piece to the huffington post detailing his points of agreement with the democratic party and saying he's a registered democrat.      of course, no such thing will happen.      i find it interesting that this prolonged discussion is happening away from the article in question, and find it cause to doubt athaenara's objectivity in this matter.  `

 :the best description of this example is the pov of the gnostics such as marcion. :essentially, they noticed apparant differences in god between the old and new testaments. also, they considered that the old testament god had moral failings - e.g. deliberately putting the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden and then telling adam and eve not to eat anything from it, and then not preventing the serpent, or the various other examples of condoning incest, murder, etc. :their conclusion was that the god of the old testament (referred to as yahweh) and the god of the new testament (referred to as god (in greek)) were not the same. they further considered that not only was yahweh evil, but yahweh is the source of all evil, i.e. the devil. they considered the serpent to be the good god. :obviously this was considered a very very very dangerous and extreme heresy by the early church, and their attacks on marcion drip with vitriol. :

  no, it's not, as you surely know. dealing with history, the poles refer to the former german cities to modern (or traditional) polish names. the russians don't speak of kaliningrad before 1945. you are too fixated on the polish-german issue, fearing some 'contagion' as i see.   


 what you have found on tarom's website are the possible flight combinations with departure point at otp, using tarom flights plus some other airlines' flights, airlines that signed agreements with tarom; e.g.: otp - yul  (bucharest otp - montreal dorval) route, operated by tarom on otp - lhr (london heathrow) one stop in london and air canada's lhr - yul flight. this cannot be counted as a tarom's international destinaton, because it is not a direct bucharest - montreal flight and it is not operated by a tarom aircraft on all its length. on the other hand, otp - lhr (bucharest - london) can be counted as an international destination for tarom. it is a direct flight, operated by a tarom aircraft.   4. the fact that you are an aviation enthousiast is a good thing and you are welcome to post any accurate and checkable information. here you a can find a website about romanian aviation fans:   regards cristibur  4.

`based on reports in the media this week, and from comments made by others who have experienced what i went through, it's apparently not uncommon in wikipedia for a single person to create several different personalities, or id's, and to then use them themselves, or in concert with others, to create the appearance of unrelated people making edits, challenging posters, harrassing and threatening others, and worse. so, your statment that ``..hmm, no, it was three people.``, rings hollow with some of us.    `

yeah, you can see by my all caps usage, and my calls for action to do boycott the company, that i was engaging in classic internet outrage.      anyone who just flat out believes all reports is an ass and most people i know don't just blindly believe every claim they hear.      i'm black(well, half black) and have experienced racism more times than i can count. every black family member i know has just as many or more stories of racism. i have seen it happen to many of my friends. by peers, by teachers, by police, by other parents.             i actually speak out against hate crime hoaxes and despise people who use the race card whenever it suits them.              but i firmly believe that there are vastly more acts of racism than false claims. the false claims are naturally going to be louder because the people making them have the singular goal of making their claim heard and getting something out of it.

`  ==a reply to the argument that benazir bhutto mispoke==  benazir was a highly intelligent, highly educated and ex-prime minister.  she is not george bush.  she does not mispeak.  this is the biggest thing since watergate.  the proof that this is a cover up is shown by the following facts:  i) the experienced reporter david frost who was interviewing benazir when she ``slipped out`` the fact that bin laden was murdered did not follow up on it.  in fact he looked palpably irritated and wondering quite how to paper over the issue.  he is in on the game, clearly.  if he was not in on the game then he would have pinned her down on this sensational bit of news.    ii) benazir was murdered in a wet job (this is a technical term) about a month after she mentioned that omar sheikh (note the triangle of first letters in history) was involved in bin laden's assasination.  iii) nobody in the world's media picked up on a story that bin laden was murdered.  so blanket world media silence on the possibility of bin laden being dead.  i kinda have a source inside who confirms this.  acutally it was years ago and not omar sheikh, but letters in names can sometimes be telling three times.`

`  you are stalin apologets. where is placed the mention of katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish povs were shot by nkvd upon stalin's personal order? we hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so i find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of katyin very painful. stalin's crimes against poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. there is no excuse to the molotov-rippentropp pact. make no mistake that was the hitler-stalin pact.  i really wish stalin ruled you, not us. you are like rumsfeld, who met saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-khomeini iran war. when will you realize that putyin's current rule is an analog of stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's khodorkovski-yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the caucasian mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). thus, by not mentioning stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new uncle joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor russian race in great danger. a repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.  stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.  the entire wwii in europe would be over in 6-9 months had stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``the history of the great patriotic war 1941-1945``. you are plain stupid to praise stalin for a ``hard earned victory in wwii``.  so powerful was the fear of stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the free world.  in churches renovated after wwii (big destruction in hungary) the face of the satan (as defeated by arch-angel michael) is always of josif stalin's on wall paintings. people were shot for painting that.  regards: tamas feher.`

`    == goodbye everybody ==   and what on earth is wrong about this article, specially if settet back where it originally belongs? i do not accuse people to be socket puppet, i do not insult them with harsh and very illustrativ words, i do not call their articles for garbage or for saying nothing usefull, or for being idiots, nor ignorant, nor do i pretend that they do not contribute with anything on the talk page and never did, nor do i revert other users contributions, as ybm and rjb specially and mainly, as well as some other new users on the page like maru that night and previous days did, and som other users belonging to the same side of the story. if i had to be banished for that so had ybm and rjb and maru too and for a much longer period of time and their text to be removed, in fact all of them that night, as they didn't say much else but cynical and fruitless comments on other people works and destructiv critiscism who wasn't justify. i tried more than 4 times to make them come v´back to ttheir mind and to sopt healding oil to the fire, but it didn't helped. they just had too much fun harrassing users all around the talk page, unpunished. an objectiv analyse of the page will not only take much time but will most certainly show how true what i state here is. there is a text that i do not found, an article with the copy/paste of the writting exchange between me and mister jean pierre voyer, where he clearly stated his doing in this affair and his cooperation with ybm in the making of falsification of evidencies, and his arrogancy and proudness in doing so, added some discrepencies in his words and a major amount of respectlessness, and you have the picture of the person behind this all story. i also received private mails from a mister rupley, who is (which is) the name of one of ybms' web site with plenty of litteracy of the kind of voyer, and with links to luven, also an ybms' website of the kind. it does not concern the bogdanovs affair, but concentrate on the theories who corroborate the making of such a fake story and its justifications in doing so. it's a hobby of some sort, like some like shakespeare or a special branch of philosophy or politic or a sub for us mostly unknown special branch of a political - philosofical - opinionated - with social ramification kind of organisation, touching a very small group of individuals inclosed in their believes.  there is plenty of the like all over the world, their reason for adding to those ideas are those people life and choices, which i do respect, but in that case, those idiosyncrasies (thats my own choice of denomination and not theirs)are being punched ininto the reality of a lot of people and involved real ideas. i think of course about the balancing act of inplanting those high flying ideas to the reality of the thousands of internet users by imposing their vues inthis bogdanov affair. by vues i do not mean the apparent version of the fact given by ybm about the validity of the actual thesis. no. it isn't what it is about. it is more complex than that. it is about playing with people reactions in a situation of confrontations and playing with lies. creating stories, ideas, like gossips who have no bund in the rality but who will nonetheless create a reaction in the people who are witnessing it at the time, and build on further from those reactions, and add more and more stuff to keep the tension and the artificial affair going on. it might not be as complicated as it sounds to bring those ideas to live, as it very quickly get a dynamic of its own who keep repeating itself, if some element are implemented along the way. it has roll this way for 2 years now, and the scenario are pretty much the same from a forum to another. one can see the same scenarios coming up, the same elements who keep coming back, the same strange behaviours at odd time, and the same surprising reactions when prooven wrong: a war take place, fill with denials, wild accusations, insults, personnal attacks, anything goes type of scenarios, with a lot of drama and tension in it, and many people getting injured, and leaving too.  mostly those who came with the unbeatable arguments as i saw it so many times on fr. physic, from june to november 2004. looking at it after without having a part of it, give the priviledged view of the whole thing in a very short period of time , in one view, and here all those flaws are very obvious and it seems estonishing that nobody noticed it at the time. the game is very clear that way, and it was clear for me that there was something wrong going on, something who wasn't right, a mismatch.  and i seek after what it could be. it was evident that the main person involved didn't have clean floor in his bag, and that he was hidding something but also that he was clearly lying and very ``good`` at it, very good

  ==some small fixes== i have tried to give the article some balance. bacque was actually an accomplished writer in canada before other losses, but it is important to point out other losses was his first foray into history. i think it's important to point out bacque is talking about losses among german pows held by the western allies. certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, german pows died in allied custody if the soviet union is included among the allies. as well, tens of thousands of german civilians died in soviet forced-labour crews. bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by anthony beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of europe before the marshall plan, the european reconstruction period, the founding of the ecsc and the beginning of the cold war. i am not familiar enough with bacque's books, especially the second one, to accurately describe them. i think someone who has read them carefully should, at least, give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand. i don't know why holocaust deniers would embrace bacque's work, since any neglect of germans held as pows by the western allies does not negate the genocide against the jews and other nazi victims. as for the plagiarisms committed by ambrose: they are not relevant to this discussion.

wow...i'm definitely gonna look that up after i write this. i'm a very strong empath, i feel people truly and completely and i can always tell a person's character by a photo alone. i always sense when something is wrong, and nobody is able to lie to me. when they do it's like..a gentle silent buzzing in my head, and a strange physical prod in my gut. i can tell those who put on happy faces but are truly suffering..and tell the difference between truly troubled teens and those who say things like "i'm so depressed...mum took my phone away. i'm so impressed i hate this family!".       that's how i got the mama nickname. i take on board troubled youths, show them the kindness they deserve and teach them that no matter what, love and friendship are the way forward. one 15 year old in my friend group has adhd, and he can get very aggressive. if we're all playing games and something doesn't go his way, he screams and shouts, tries crashing the server, calls everyone horrible names..and of course the groups all yelling at him..and i've always been the one to calm him. just by treating him like a damn human being. and because i have a true love for police and other emergency services, he now wants to be a good cop and put bad guys away. that makes me a very proud mama ♡    my boyfriend might have high sensitivity.  his intuition saved my life last month.    sorry for the eiffel tower of text lol. i guess when you meet another person who has this blessed but cursed gift, i feel i can talk to them without fear of being judged for being a big soft ball of emo fluff lol. my bf is quite feminine and moves very elegantly. he has marfan syndrome so he's quite lanky xd. he's one of those people where like...just being near him makes everything brighter. he lights up the room and takes pride in his appearance.  he's always getting bullied and yelled at..called a poof, a homo, gayboy etc. it doesn't phase him. he's comfortable being straight and a little bit girly. i just wish i didn't cry if someone so much as giggles at my appearance :(

`   * i personally have noticed something at wikipedia and in the discussion, which i would rather call ``british historical revisionism``. i'm sorry, but many britons try to spin and squeeze facts and truthes. additionally, they base their argumentation on statements like ``everyone knows german sources aren't reliable`` etc. and just quote british sources in contrast. british sources have been proven to be wrong and propagandistic before, too - but somehow this doesn't matter to those ``unbiased`` historians. thus things like bombing german civilians, which was also described as crime by the british prime minister of that time and which can be called genocide if you refer to what ``bomber harris`` said, is being justified like ``it is okay to kill civilians with bombs, but it is a war crime if you do so with a gun`` by recent british revisionists historians. the job of many british historians seems to be to ``improve`` britain's image by any mean.   `

so then life is good? great, we're on the same page. i'm honestly glad you feel that way.      and does knowing that death being the end of life (something good) is completely unavoidable, completely unchangeable, change anything for you?      it can't be escaped, so why spend all of the time you do have free from death thinking about it, fearing it? you don't change anything. you only waste the time you do have on the most meaningless topic.      does knowing the eggs in your fridge will inevitably go bad stop you from baking a cake with them while they're still fresh? no, because cake is delicious and depriving yourself of cake because you know the ingredients have a time limit is nonsensical. similarly, does knowing the eggs will inevitably go bad stop you from putting them in the fridge so you can extend the time in which you can use them? no.      likewise, knowing there is a time limit to your life shouldn't stop you from living it. nor does it make it nonsensical to try to extend it, it's just that at some point you might as well bake the cake, because the end is inevitable.

`, 25 march 2006 (utc)  :::::::::the opinions tisthammer is insisting on adding are not about josephson or about natasha demkina. they're about profs. hyman, wiseman, and me. josephson has nothing really to say about natasha. instead, he argues that we're a bunch of unethical crooks. that appears to be why tisthammer wants the link added. and he doesn't care that it violates wiki guidelines. he says he's willing to compromise by allowing me to add a statement or two denying that we're a bunch of unethical crooks. he calls that a compromise.   :::::::::this is tisthammer's idea of mediation: immediately take a side and argue for it by misrepresenting wikipedia guidelines and the meaning of words like ``primary source.`` josephson is no primary source. he's never met natasha, never tested her, never spoke with her and his only personal knowledge of the discovery channel program comes from watching it like millions of other tv viewers. he's no more a ``primary source`` than is tisthammer himself.  :::::::::if tishammer wants to create a new wiki article on josephson's fights with skeptics, he should do so and stop pretending he's a mediator. there's much too much bilge in this discussion page already.  13:39`

(e)  <\br>now someone is blocking me for another time, without reacting to any of my my content. for example: no reaction to the wp:upnot thing. so i am still accused of vandalism. i want it out.  re: trusilver: please explain what do you mean by: ``your message was meant to do nothing more inflame and disrupt``? (do we mis a word somewhere (like it means to say ``more to inflame``?), don't worry, could happen to any chief justice). now lets get serious again: maybe mr/mrs trusilver did not read it carefully, but i want it to be read and reacted to more carefully. m/m trusilver has not reacted to one single clearly written point. why then should or how could i react seriously then? i could rephrase the same things, but being clear will block me more time.  i should not be reblocked for argumenting my case. above i wrote an explicit and clear reason why i wrote such and so, and illustrating that the  editor or administrator had misread and/or misinterpretated. that is what i wrote, above. if you expect me to say nothing to favor my own case - well - please say so (beforehand). if not: i am free to react here more so.  if someone else reads it like it is ``you are infalaming`` (without clearifying)) - well, i am only making my case. so the reader (wikipedia-administrator?) may be too sensitive to judge. then, please, leave it to someone else.  to be sure: if this reaction leads to anothor (unqualified) blocking, i will withdraw anyting i said or wrote in my whole life. i will even deny being born. as i wrote before: i do not seek unblocking, nor extra blocking. i want my contributions to be read and taken saeriously. even by contestants. -  `

`  an event in this article is a april 30 selected anniversary (may be in html comment)  == a question has been bugging me == from the time the first us military advisors stepped in to vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all us troops in 1973 the ussr and china repeatedly warned kennedy, johnson and nixon not to cross the dmz and directly invade north vietnam. that seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the north but my question is were the south vietnamese forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade north vietnam? did ussr and china ever warn the south not to invade the north?   :considering the u.s.'s coordination with and funding for arvn, i'm sure that they would take south vietnamese ground forces in north vietnam much the same way they'd take marines. the only ``crossing of the dmz`` that occurred was american bombing raids.   :probably not, but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off.  23 july 2005 ::it's hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade s.v. from doing anything. but i agree with cjk, the limited competence of the arvn in offensive operations seems well-established in the historical record, e.g. the offensive in laos.   03:04, 2005 july 24 (utc) :::the forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the south and its dissident ``south`` vietnamese were often the target of u.s. bombing. keep in mind that the terms ``north`` and ``south`` were circumstantial, and not actually representative of the demographic split. ``north and south`` often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war, which american soldiers, for example, found to be not the reality: many (perhaps most) people in the ``democratic`` south were pro-independence, despite the western-allied/ethnic catholic elite. hence any use of ``north and south`` carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts. -|  ::::i don't know what you are talking about. we were discussing whether or not the soviets or chinese would react if south vietnam sent its forces to invade north vietnam.  24 july 2005 :::::``i dont know what you are talking about.`` well, it would really help if you did, wouldnt it? -|  :well maybe you shouldn't bring up unrelated issues in the middle of a specific discussion.  25 july 2005 i'd just like to commend the recent additions to the article.   :actually, to my understanding, there were still many rescue raids (of captured pows) or commando attacks that were conducted by either u.s. commandos or the ``biet dong quan`` (the arvn equivalent) against the north during the war. it's an honour to meet celebrities like you, trey and parker stone. i appreciate your criticisms to my editions on the vietnam war page. - . ::well others watching this page are quite capable of rving marxist language and pov it seems.   :::and would rving 'capitalist language and pov' be ok with you? -|  ::i don't know what ``capitalist language`` means, but if it existed and was pov then i would have no problems with its reversion.   ::we were actually talking about a full scale attack by south vietnam, not a raid.  24 july 2005  let's assume the south vietnamese army, without us troop support, did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the dmz in to the north, would the chinese and/or ussr intervene and play the ``defending an ally card`` for the north exactly like how we did for the south?   :i know this is a hypothetical assumption, but still, it's irrelevant, because the arvn was never able to operate well without u.s. assistance. so answering your hypothetical, if that did happen active intervention in the form of chinese or soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the pavn's superior capabilities. if we had somehow managed to make the arvn into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over north vietnam then yes, i'd expect the pla (army in china) to intervene just like they had in north korea. but american go

`please read the following article carefully in order to understand the real world-wide recognised history  - as somebody else said, the ``nation of transylvania`` does not exist, it is pure romania and romanians! therefore, we will tell some real history here. within the chronicles of herodotus , one may find that he described the dacians(getae) as the nation living within the present romanian and moldavian territory, including the part that is called transylvania today, which means “beyond the forests”, after the latin definition given by romans and which consisted of the carpathian mountains and the pannonian plains. a more accountable map can be found here: [URL] .. therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as geton (plural getae) in greek writings, and as dacus (plural daci) and getae in roman documents. the dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the romans and dacia was transformed into a roman province. following, it was  a period of romanization, period when the main romanian people rose. as an answer to the magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual hungary is related to the invasion of the mongols ruled by genghis han and the huns ruled by attila within the european territory. after their settlement within the pannonian plains, the hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. as a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of dacians and the territory within they lived, called today transilvania/transylvania. the truth that has to be admitted is that dacians/getae were here as a nation before the hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. moreover, neither the mongols and huns nor the actual hungarians were here before the romanization of dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the romanian people. international history admits that the hungarians appeared within today’s hungary territory around the 9th century a.c. (according to britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual tibet region/mongolia. after settlement they conquered transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. bear in mind that romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from daco-romans times and they will never stop viewing trasilvania as their own home! if the hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the transylvania land. peace!     `

` == a blog post i think is important == first, i appreciate the notes that were left recently, and the ones left during the february drama.  i will probably be back, but not like i was before.  i love wikimedia and everything it is trying to do.  i wanted to be a part of it.  more, i wanted to show its potential.  the worst misconception about me is that i am arrogant about my work.  i most want people to realize that everything i did, they can do too.  you don't even need to do what i did; your own secret hopes and ambitions on here have the potential to succeed.    it's not self-promotion.  if you are contributing work of such high quality that you could actually make a career for yourself, then wikipedia is damn lucky to have you.  if what you give is crap, face it:  your stuff will be removed, nobody will stick up for you and you'll have zero hopes of ever branching beyond wikipedia.  this is important:  you should strive to contribute material that is of such high quality people actually think you could be a professional (but the ridiculous argument that you are using wikipedia to doing that is stupid beyond belief).    i outlined on my blog how i went about doing what i did on here, how you could replicate it if you wanted, and general advice.  i don't care if anyone follows it.  but i certainly hope it explains how unexceptional my contributions were; that is, if only other people attempted what i did.    i'm an artist - i wanted to work on here and give something back.  but i never wish to be a professional photographer or journalist/reporter.  i realize that's a shock for many to believe.  wikipedia is a great public space to attempt art, whether it be journalism and information as art, or photography that is encyclopedic before it is artistic.    here's the blog post where i try to explain how i succeeded to gain access, improved my photography and made a reputation for myself simply for doing what i believed in on wikipedia:  blog.shankbone.org/2008/07/19/david-shankbone-finally-tells-you-how-to-replicate-his-success.aspx  if contributing high quality work that is recognized on and off wikipedia is self-promotion, then we need more self-promoters who try to create such high quality. david '''''' `

`  hey again. sorry about taking more than a month to get my act together! i've been busy with school, real life, and admin stuff. i've looked over victoria's article and fixed a few things, but nothing major jumps out at me as needing to be fixed. after you look over wilson's article, let's go ahead and give our ga announcement to the project. there's a huge backlog at wp:gac under the sports section, so i think we should go ahead and list them asap, before another 40 articles are listed before them. in other news, i'm working on dawn marie psaltis in my sandbox because i found a lot of good sources for her when i was researching wilson.  `

   == commonwealth - from england? == rather a lot of the people who went and lived in the bay colony would have preferred that england had not recently ceased being its first commonwealth.  might that be the reason the state eventually took that style and continued in that fashion?   from this distance one of the striking features of the commonwealth is the presence of the fsf hq there, and another is that recently it was the least craven state wrt microsoft.  the liberal tradition is remarked upon.  medically, the town of framingham is one of the most carefully studied populations and much work on prevention of cardiovascular disease is at least partly based on it.  worthy of note and cross-linking perhaps?  i don't live anywhere near it, so i'll leave this here for thought.

` as  could be clearly read here, i wasnt asking for any unblock, but to talk to tawker, so unless you had the intention to contact him for me, or to contact me directly i dont see why you have put your finger in it. please any other admi coming here, do not remake the same mistake and give my smoke signals further to the rigth target: tawker. i dont care about being unblock, i do care about being treated as a person and been given acomment and else that outsiders dont mingle in a case that they do not know a single thing about. being reverted for not adering 100% to all mormons theories is in my view a direct attack to the first amendement. here are some proove for what i have advanced in some of my edits (i have edited from the 10th of june 2006 in the evening to the 14th of june 2006 in the afternoon, with being subject ton unfounded personal attacks and reverts without explainations from my first edits. both from other editors (all mormons) and from administrators who were also mormons. as you are not an administrator and not the one this edit very visually is adressed to, so you should have step away or contact the person himself to ask him to take a look here. your actions in that case are counter productiv pgk and waist my time and place in wikipedia.  try to bode for this or use it as a learning stuff for future times. do not make the mistake of using your previous type of experiences in vandalism as a stonehenge model for all situations. take into account the basis and what actually occured in the case at hand and that the people who generated personnals attacks against me did it without having been subject to such on my part, and only by assuming things about me who werent true. even when confronted with that fact they pursued their personal attacks in form of racism and accusing me of lying and calling me a troll, and all their edits stating those have not been removed nor do those editors have been sanctioned nor even warned. most probably because they appeal to mormon administrators to begin with. i have written contributions in only 2 days, before all were reverted without explainations. that i was blocked on the basis of npa is a cynical joke, as i thad tried for days to make the other editors to stop agressing me ´by answering my edits with personal attacks and to instead adrees the content of those edits. i have in all my answers to them specifically and always adress the contain of their edits directly and accuratly, that it had contain also similarity with personal attacks has to be seen in the ligth that their edits were made of 90% of personal attacks and false allegations about my motives and source of informations, thought i had clearly stated what those were several times, and even was falsly citated on words and sentences i had never uttered! the feeling of being done wrong was growing for each of those unfounded attacks, and instead of getting clear and founded and logical responses, i was confronted with further illigetimates handling as a pseudo archiving of the talk page where all edits, incl the 4 th last, had been removed, and the talk page was left blanck, and was officialy choosen to dont reply to my first edit, who was never adressed, meaning its contain and not me as a person. the last edit written by me had been deleeted from the archive and the historic, which i didnt accept, as i know it was against wiki rules. no explainations nor warning were given nor the possibility to contact the admi who had done so as on his talk page he pretended to be on holyday until the end of june wich i found odd as he had done those actions a couple of hours ago. nobody being there to can talk that matter through with, nor any others being named to take over, and no plausible explanations being given for doing those hidden reverting of the page, i took the initiative to reinteger the last 4 edits in the actual empty talk page, as mean to pursue the communication and arrived at a propper reaction regarding the contain of my contribution and not personal attacks against me nor disuasiv terror actions being made against me. i argued about it and explained my actions abundently both before i did it, and at the end of those, with a clear stand point concerning my worries about the freedom of expression being severely enfringe in wikipedia and the danger of letting this type of actions going on without control, as well as seeing wikipedia getting too onesided on a relevant amount of articles.  i hope this clarified some point and i didnt appreciate being bulled nor sanctioned by an admi who officially recognised not having read the edits he removed and reverted and archived, nor having read my explaination for reinserting some of those from the archive to the talk page, and also being warned and threatened and banned from an admi, the same, who didnt look at all at the contain

`(reset tab) i think it's important to define 'hatred' and 'hostility'. many christians and fundamentalists believe that it is their duty as part of their mission to bring christianity to all non-believers. whether the effects are positive or not, proselytizing is not hostility per se. the key ingredient is in the intention of the person doing it. websters defines hostility as a ``deep-seated usually mutual ill will`` so an important ingredient is a very strong dislike towards a person or group. warning people who (in your belief) are taking the wrong moral path does not qualify unless you insult them in the process, especially if you hold yourself to the same standard. chick's tract is equivalent to a believer in reincarnation telling us we will live my next life as a lower form of life or be barred from nirvana unless we embrace her religionannoying, yes, hostility or hatred, no.    `

  == how could they miss the world trade center comparison? ==  this article levels many criticisms, but does not explain the timidity of many anti-tobacco campaigns.  consider that the collapse of the world trade center caused the tragic death of 2,750 people, while tobacco claims 1.4 million lives annually.  comparing one year of tobacco fatalities with one thousand world trade towers seems too obvious to miss.  in fifteen years the world trade towers equivalent to tobacco fatality rates would cover every square inch of manhattan, and the simulated collapse of even a third of that number would be a most memorable image for television.  instead a visit to their site yields only a cow-milking game.  are they serious?

  == templates ==  thanks for working with the  template by adding it to articles.  while bouncing around the articles i noticed that you put in a  template.  nice work on that.  are you going to be doing the rest of the years as well?  just curious,  | 


  i was attempting to make a talk to animals article which is a well known band that i saw at a show last friday. i found a lot of references to put in the article and then when i hit submit, i got a huge thing saying blah blah blah your article is going to be deleted. and that made me really angry. and i spent like 30 minutes on it cause i was trying to figure out how everything works. it said killondude did it and i revenged so sorry for calling him some harsh names. you don't have to lift the ban or anything. just delete my account. i am so over wikipedia now. i shouldn't have even donated to them.  bleh.  wheres the delete account link?  how do i know if youll even get this. wtf    


you brought up something that has been a sore spot for me for many years. i've personally brought up my illness somewhere near the early stages of my relationship when i felt i had the intention to stay long term and i had a procedure coming up that pertained to it. i have a lot of doctor appointments, a lot of procedures and complications that come with it.  it is not his responsibility to know every road block that steps in the way of my healing. my health can be a huge emotional burden.       not many people are able to compartmentalize a partner's wellness and happiness. it's something that has weighed on me and took several years for me to come to terms with. i do not want to give my partner that job at my current relationship status (1 year in). i will not give him the same emotional burden i go through if he's not sharing my home. it is my healing, my health and my heavy responsibility to bear.


that's interesting, did stalin visit him in a mexican prison to present him with the order of lenin? or is it a fact that it was khrushchev who gave it to mercader years later (after the death of stalin)? and how exactly does any of the above prove that stalin ordered the assassination of trotsky?      


  == catchpole edits articles to suit his own warped way of thinking ==  i have to agree with many of the above comments about catchpole.  i noticed yesterday that he deleted my contributions to a topic simply because he didn't like the facts i was presenting.  this user should be banned from wikipedia as he is a nefarious character.


`  ==tlaquepaque== hi! i just thought maybe the thing about toro y castillo was a local idiomatic expression with a totally different meaning, like ``a ruckus`` or something. maybe someone will come along and know. anyway - off to bed!  `


  == semitic ==  i have read the page semitic yet i'm still confused by it and a debate i heard on tv yesterday. to what exactly does the term 'semitic' refer? the tv claimed the term refers to not only jews but arabs and all peoples descended from those in the middle eastern region. i always thought it referred only to jews (as in 'anti-semitic'). do you care to wade into this quagmire and help clear it up?  


  == amcom article ==  hi  earlier today i noticed that there is no article on amcom, and i posted on the amnet talk page, before moving it to talk:amcom (because although the network is called amnet, the actual company is called amcom). i didn't realize until later that there was already an amcom (actually amnet) page that had been deleted. after reading the explanation for the deletion, i'm not sure whether amcom really has enough notability or not. however, if we do want to make an amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the company's notability.  if you are still interested, take a look at this article i found:   if you want to reply to me, make sure you either reply on , or leave a note there saying that you have replied elsewhere. otherwise, i won't know that you've replied.  welcome and good luck! -

`  van hoogstraten (r on the application of) v governor hmp belmarsh [2002] ewhc 1965 admin  jackson j  case no: co/4302/2002 date: 23/09/2002  40. the term ``legal adviser`` in rule 2 must embrace any lawyer who (a) is chosen by the prisoner, and (b) is entitled to represent the prisoner in criminal proceedings to which the prisoner is a defendant. on the evidence before the court, mr di stefano is an italian avvocato who falls within the definition of ``eec lawyer`` in the 1978 order. he has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in ongoing criminal proceedings. it therefore follows that mr di stefano falls within the term ``his solicitor or counsel`` in rule 2 of the prison rules. 41. under rule 38(1) mr di stefano must be afforded reasonable facilities for interviewing his client in belmarsh prison in connection with the current criminal proceedings.  mr justice jackson: thank you. the claimant has won on the grounds set out in his claim form. the claimant has won on the live issues before the court. the proper order in all the circumstances of this case is that costs should follow the event. the defendant must pay the claimant's costs of the judicial review proceedings.  van hoogstraten, re [2002] ewhc 2015 admin  jackson j  case no: co/4302/2002 date: 26/09/2002  10. the argument which mr johnson deployed at the hearing last week was to the following effect: an italian avvocato is not a solicitor or a barrister; therefore he is not one of those persons entitled under rule 38 of the prison rules 1999 to make a legal visit to mr van hoogstraten in belmarsh prison. there was before the court last week evidence that mr di stefano is an italian avvocato. there are a number of references to this in the documentation before me. perhaps most pertinently the bundle at page 67 includes mr di stefano's identification card and halfway down we see: ``professione avvocato``. on the right of that there is a photograph of mr di stefano and his signature.  11. there was no reservation by the defendant to the effect that mr di stefano was not an avvocato at all. argument proceeded last week on the question whether or not an italian avvocato fell within rule 2(1) and rule 38(1) of the prison rules.  17. it should be borne in mind that mr di stefano is the lawyer who has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in criminal proceedings. he has been chosen as the lead lawyer to represent the claimant, and under article 6 of the european convention on human rights the claimant is entitled to be represented by the lawyer of his choice. that must entail the opportunity to confer with the lawyer of his choice before he appears for sentence.  25. mr di stefano has been appointed as the principal legal adviser of the claimant. it seems to me that mr di stefano has exercised wise judgment in the legal team which he has appointed. he has selected as one of the leading counsel to make the plea in mitigation a leading authority in the field of criminal sentencing. mr tam submits that with such a distinguished legal team it is quite unnecessary for mr di stefano to visit his client in prison. he can receive instructions at secondhand, and article 6 does not require mr di stefano's presence.  26. i do not agree. mr van hoogstraten has chosen mr di stefano as his principal legal adviser. the choice of principal legal adviser is for the client. it is not for me; it is not for counsel in this case or anybody else. it is a matter for the client, and if he wishes to appoint an italian avvocato as his principal legal adviser, and that italian avvocato has rights to practise in this country under the 1978 order, then mr van hoogstraten is entitled to take that course.   van hoogstraten, re [2002] ewhc 2015 admin jackson j  and more important the concession made by the home office    71. if your lordship then goes on to page 61, your lordship will see the letter written to the central criminal court. in the second paragraph of that the letter is said to enclose the documentation referred to therein, including the power of attorney and the certificate that he has as to his good standing as an avvocato in italy. then in the fourth paragraph, the identification card which describes him as an avvocato.   72. now, it appears that the certificates on 64, 65 and 66 are the certificates referred to, but as your lordship will recall i think a concession was made last week that those certificates are in fact of good character in terms of criminal convictions and charges and do not relate to his status as an avvocato. and then the identification card on 67 itself describes him as “avvocato``. one does not know which of the two ambiguous meanings that might have.   73. mr justice jackson: woul

`  == justanother == hey! i'm glad you wrote me. this guy is exactly the kind of person i do not like. i don't know where to begin describing everything that is wrong with him. i can see it in the replies to you as well. l.ron's military career, if it is fabricated, is obviously worth discussing. i don't know why it would be fabricated, it wouldn't change my opinion of him or anythiing, so many times things aren't what they seem, but it's still worth looking into. it isn't 'he said, she said', it can be figured out what the truth is. and he says anything else is pr. this is what bugs me about justanother, he says things like they are fact. no, it isn't just pr. it could be that he lied, it could be that there was a mistake, etc. that isn't pr.  ok, now i'm reading the posts on yourpage. this is so hard to understand. you're not supposed to talk about scientology with him, he says? ``is that clear``? see,he speaks to people with an air of superiority, like he is the voice of reason, of authority.``and i have no doubt that you consider yourself the soul of equanimity and justice.`` complete projection.   whoa, i'm on the barbara schwarz page, he did this with me to. i don't understand those people who feel the need to inform you of obvious thigns you would never do like you need them to inform you otherwise you would do it. he did that to me at first when we were friendly regarding editing scientology pages (telling me not to do this or that, which i would never have done).   i think the good thing is that this is just the internet. if it were real life, we would be able to tell in a second what was up with this guy and we wouldn't apply him the same weight that we apply other people. i sometimes forget that when i use the net because you're not getting the feel of the person saying the weird thing. it used to bug me some of the things that critics of scientology used to say, and then i saw photos and video of them, and it made sense. you could tell they weren't really there, so i wasn't upset anymore. i'd love to see what this guy looks like. i'd probably end up feeling sorry for him and have compassion and overlook all the incredibly rude traits he has.   i don't know how to explain how things got bad between us. it's just his personality, who he is, and i disagree iwth it, find it incredibly rude and invalidating to other people, and just let him know.    you're on the scientology's 'enemies' list? what happened? you defintely didn't imply anythiing negative about scientology, it's all good. people i know make jokes about scientology and it's totally fine. i know what i don't like and don't agree it and i'm not sensing any of that from you. another thing about anynobdoy, is he does seem like everything is pro-scientology, no matter what, and i've noticed that with some scientologists, but that's not me, and that's wrong. i dislike a lot of scientologists i've met because i can tell the kind of people they are and the kinds of things that they would do or think, and i'm just not okay with that. scientology isn't some group that you join and become this ideal scientologist and just turn into that. it's like when i go to the gym. i don't adapt the feeling and personality of the gym and the people in the gym. i go there to work my body, to use it as a tool. i do the same thing with scientology. i really hate when people do that because what starts happening is they start feeling like they're better than others because they ``act`` more like an ideal scientologist than people who aren't doing that, and all sorts of other things, which i think our friend here might've done.  )  that was long and rambling, but i've been up all night with little sleep ! write me back.  `

 :::: except that's not whats going on here at all. it should be pretty apparent at this point from the lack of actual help greg has given to blps that he really doesn't care about them. it is a convenient issue that he can make noise about. since many wikipedians are (understandably) very concerned about blps if he claims that's what he really cares about he can sound far more concerned. it should be very telling that greg didn't pick up claiming about blps until very late. it was never an issue for him until well after he was blocked. he's simply found a convenient thing that he can use to make his behavior seem more acceptable. if he really cared he'd point out to us the various problems.

`  ::: hi marcuse. i see you've run into sojambi pinola. don't mind him, he's a buffoon. he is friend of biff rose's. they mention each other on their respective web spots. looks like the two of them are on here basahing other people until they stand alone as edit king. too bad someone else wrote about rose's own anti semiticism, and racism. poor sojambi has been trying to fix it ever since. the sad thing is, he is so one sided, he has a difficult time persuading others of his npov- therefore he lashes out, and you were caught up in the crossfire(evidence here[]) notice, he's only comparing what he wants you to see. the connection? well there isn't any really, but by creative use of wiki skills he tries to cover his own manipulations by using hanging you up as the villain. it's a rather typical obfuscation tehnique. by accusing every person who posts something that makes an edit to his work, he then marks them as a bad user. it's also reminiscent of those toubling republican smear tactics of last year- only translated to this site. he's a schmuck. claims to be latino, then claims to be jewish, then claims to be black, then claims to be white. next he'll claim to be a woman. he's already claimed to be a few other people, and it was his vandalism of other peoples talk page and of the rose page itself that got it frozen in the first place. also of note is his complete inability to sleuth. i would find his ``detective`` skills humorous if they weren't so evil. good luck, and i bet your singing voice would improve, if only you would practice. `

  == maybe you should ask musical linguist... ==  ahh... she problaby does not have time.  ok. here is the joke: mark fuhrman, with his lapd police badge and his gun, with all of those yummmy bullets in it, would do traffic stops on black people.  if you think that was a dwb kind of thing, well, other might feel that way too... anyway the joke is this:  he did not love those niggers that stopped, he loved the effect that using, under color of authority (pun intended), the word nigger has on them emotionally.  see, if he could just get an emotional repsonse from those niggers, he might be able to create an excuse in order to insert some of those yummy bullets into them.  mostly, those niggers just sat and and took it.  some non-admin wikipedians find themselves in the same situation as those guys. ironically, mark probably makes a lot more money with his books now than he ever did as a policeman.  provided that people merely purchase and read his books, but do not actually take them seriously, maybe we are all better off that way. he's got more money.  he does not use the n-word anymore.  he does not carry a gun and use the n-word under color of authority.  surely, that is best of all possible worlds, is it not?

`  ``the most likely danger is a few hundred or low thousands more will die. but the nature of terrorism is that it relies on people not realising that they will die anyway, with probability 1; and the chances of getting struck by lightning are literally higher than dying from terrorism. but guess which one has the press and the politicians acting on it? not lightning. that's the real point isn't it? `` that is a ridiculous point. there is no war on lightning simply because there are more deaths caused by lightning strikes that happen about by natural causes. we are at war with willful guerilla groups and states that sponsor activities to over throw or terrorize stable governments. the difference now then was then is that the bush administration has called it so a war, and has opted to use the military along with the fbi and the cia.   the war in iraq was not about oil. that is speculation. you can try to ``prove`` it with all the shoddy evidence you have that probably points to other things, that you try and twist to fit the picture that it was about oil. the war was about upholding un resolutions dealing with saddam hussien to account for his weapons of mass destruction. the onus was sqarely on him and he failed to comply. the only thing that terrorism had to do with iraq was that saddam had ties to terrorism and could employ the use of terror if he was desperate. the case for the removal of hussien was being discussed even in the clinton administration.   this situation is so easy to comprehend. i dont know why is has to be tripped up by global oil crusades and tales of maniacal conservatives that want to rule the earth through their multi-national corporations. dont you find it odd that the ones spouting this non sense are the anti-globalization crusaders with neo-marxist tainted glasses that see profit and global finance as the ills of society? and anyone who disagrees with their world view in politics is ``in`` on the action?   the other half of naysayers seem to to be the isolationist hard right that see any intervention and free trade as an enemy of the constitution.`

oh boy, where is francis? grandmaster, i can not know any other words than pov pushing to discribe what you are doing. where did i ever said anything about nakhichevan population in 1830s, do you see me ever contesting those statistics? do you even see me contesting 14th century material? besides, nakhichevan discribed there is not nakhichevan with its current bordering. grandmaster, don't get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. taking nakhichevan as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150,000, it was its most important period, after the 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by armenians from the vicinities of van, and after the desertion of ani, people moved there. julfa alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. the closest to the abbas period you cam is of over 200 years, while i provided data which covered that period. you are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. here, let readd the materials i have provided.  ::for the next four centuries, armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of ani and the seljuk turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. in the meantime, persia ( iran) experienced a revival under the shi'i safavids, who became the adversaries of the sunni ottomans. from 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in armenia. armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250,000 armenians were forcibly transferred by shah 'abbas to iran. by the seventeenth century, the armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. the merchants of julfa in nakhichevan were among those who were brought to iran by shah 'abbas; he moved them to a suburb of isfahan where they built the new julfa community. the support of 'abbas and subsequent shahs enabled the armenians to expand iran's trade with india, china, russia, and western europe. these merchants helped to make the persian gulf an important trade center. an ethnohistorical dictionary of the russian and soviet empires by james s. olson, lee brigance pappas, nicholas c. j. pappas. p. 44  ::shah abbas devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of armenia, as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population. [from it] he settled some 13,000 families in the silk-growing northern provinces of gilan and mazanderan bordering on the caspian. (source: the armenians and the east india company in persia in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries by r. w. ferrier, the economic history review, new series, vol. 26, no. 1 (1973), p. 39)  ::linda k. steinmann in her work shah 'abbas and the royal silk trade 1599-1629, vol. 14, no. 1 (1987), pp. 68-74 covers the evacuation of the armenians, and to a lesser extent elsewhere of georgians, but nowhere does she say anything about any evacuation of tartars.  ::ina baghdiantz mccabe covers the evacuation in her work the shah's silk for europe's silver: the eurasian trade of the julfa armenians in safavid iran and india (1530-1750), i don't see anything about tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important tartar population in nakhichevan.  ::josepho barbaro while visiting the devastation reports destruction of armenian towns and its desertion, not tartars.  ::sir william ouseley during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the armenian city during the evacuation.  ::in 1603 shah 'abbas, the great safavid ruler of persia, sent an expedition into armenia in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the turks. the death of the sultan mahmud iii in december 1603 and the succession of his son ahmed, a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy conquest in the course of which both retreating turks and invading persians plundered the armenians. the persian victory was followed by a forced emigration of the population to the shah's capital of isfahan. « that dragon of hell, shah abbas, nourished from the beginning in the ways of the serpent, saw with an eye of envy the prosperity of the christians. » so arakel of tauriz, the seventeenth-century armenian historian, puts it, and it was indeed the skill of new... armenia was left desolates... (a seventeenth-century typological cycle of paintings in the armenian cathedal at julfa, t. s. r. boase, journal of the warburg and courtauld institutes, vol. 13, no. 3/4 pp.323-324)  ::d.m. lang writes that one of the two major reasons of the deportation was: ...he desired to make use of the industrial and commercial talents of the armenians... (bulletin of the school of oriental and african studies, university of london, vol. 32, no. 3 (1969) p. 622) julfa population was so i

`  :the gothic culture was a horror movement. the first goths look like corpses with white faces, occult symbols etc. there was no aesthetic or romantic thing. this romantic thing is a phenomenon of the 1990s or an influence of the new romantic movement and has nothing to do with the traditional gothic subculture. the same with gothic architecture, gothic novels etc. the name of the gothic subculture came from the gothic music, a dark, punky music genre, related to death rock and horrorpunk. there was no relation to the gothic architecture, but a preference for dead and old buildings in ruins, cemetaries, symbols of decay, etc. it was a ``death romanticism``. the term ``gothic`` means ``dark, gloomy, spooky``. i agree, that there are new developments. but now you have a culture without any relation to the roots. metaller are listening to metal music, punks are listening to punk music, but goths are listening to futurepop, metal and techno? bullshit! they're not goths! they're derivatives or parallel movements.    :btw: do you have any reliable, scientific source that definitions of gothic rock have shifted over the time? a drum machine was in use since the early days of gothic rock. it's not a mid-80s thing.`

  == why did you erase aba can cure autism. ==  i added a ref tag that leaded to the website saying that, the first person who invented applied behavior analysis (aba), cured dozens of kids and was very successful. my son had autism until he was 5, he had no language, had motor skills, constant tantrums/meltdowns, avoided eye contact, he would cry when the motor in the back of the car would star it would hurt his ears — sensory issues, he had trauma, sleeping problems etc. he had an aba home-instructed program, it turned out very succesful, he gained his language, and no longer had autism, he is a pre-teen now and goes to a special-ed school for the iq of average or above, he is functioning now. so i know this for a fact. it even said it on the article, but doesn't mean every person with autism could get better from it through early intervention, not with severe autism. so could you please revert my edit. thanx!

  == why it is so hard considering solipsism wrong? ==  if even accepting that super-dubious statement of that 'the only thing i know existing is my mind'[1], and even further, accepting (blindly) conception of 'all of world can be my illusion', and then realising not all of world is directly controlled to you you think there's 'bum'. but stop, you can't know whether 'bum' exists. then, solipsist say 'world is my illusion' but how can one know if the illusion exists? if we state, that the only thing existing is your mind, you can't go then stating something else exists, like even works of that mind. if you state [1], you live in nothing, but how parts of nothing can be different to each other? but since you get 'the only thing i know existing is my mind' statement, and 'i think, therefore i am' conclusion i can ask four questions: -why if i think, then i am? -why it is stated that i think? -why i know my mind exists? -why i know that my mind exists? those can be summed with: -why is my mind is supposed to be the only thing to exist? -why i know only one thing exists? -why my mind is that the only thing existing? etc as you can see, solipsism is unable to answer any of these, as it is only concerned about those statement and conclusion.

  == re: 1962 ==  i would, but i'm very busy with a project of my own. i'm trying to get all articles in the 2003 ahs to ga or above. i've already finished all but three of them (bill, isabel, and juan). i would help after i'm finished, but i don't like the wpac much; not enough info, and never any impact pics. there might be 20 storms that have usable pictures for wpac storms since 1950, and that's an optimistic guess. most wpac storm articles will not have impact pics. sat pics, on the other hand... i don't know where they would be find (really old and wpac = unlikely).

`   :is it scientific to attribute an event a, to cause b, where cause b was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? don't answer the questions beyond that ::well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. there are several major fundamental problems here.    ::first, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth. natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here. this is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. no evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.    ::second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with ``probabilities``. if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? if you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say ``well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone must have designed it``. this is such a perversion of science. you can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. id is just making up their numbers.    ::finally, your example has a->b, where b was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, ``b`` is unknown. your a->b example might qualify as forensic science, if ``a`` were a dead body and ``b`` were a bullet in the heart. you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. you don't have that with life on earth. you have one scenario, ``a``, and you have no other cases to observe or test. so, in that sense, a->b is not scientific if you've never actually observed ``b``. (btw, b is teh intelligent designer, which has never been observed). so, in that sense, no, it isn't science.  `

` ::well, you almost have it right, but not quite. its like going over a hill.  to quote chaiken, ``it was as if the moonship were coasting up a hill, one that became less and less steep as it went along.  about two days from now, on the afternoon of december 23, apollo 8 would reach the gentle crest of that hill, the place where the earth's gravitational influence gave way to the moon's.  from then on it would begin falling toward its destination.`` (chaiken, p. 95)  all bodies in space have a gravitational field, even an astronaut on an eva has a gravitational field around them.  in this case, the moon's gravitational influence becomes stronger, and the earth's disappears, even though the moon orbits the earth, it's the moon's gravity that is having an effect on the spacecraft when it reaches a certain point in space.  therefore, it is correct to say that apollo 8 was the first manned mission to leave the earth's influence. `

`  == fare thee weel, my fine friend! ==  i'm back in town for a day and thought i'd drop by again.  i took a look at how your rfar was coming along, as well as your evidence you are marshalling in your ``sandbox`` at [].  i must say i am rather disappointed at the slight nature of said evidence.  not that i'm going to be around, but i'm sure you don't have a very strong hand, as it were.  as i've said before, i've already explained the alternate accounts, and users casito (and soltak also to a smaller extent) have been just as uncivil to me as i had been to them.  casito basically accused me of being a pedophile/stalker of some kind in his statement to the arbitration committee after all.  one thing that did seriously concern me and that i'd like to, if you please, elucidate, is that casito's statement about ``website defacement`` being a ``crime`` in ``many jurisdictions`` is absolutely 100% misleading in our context.  first, there are no local jurisdictional issues here, the internet is regulated at the national level in the u.s.  (i'm sure you knew that).  second, like i told casito, this is a wiki, any changes on here, no matter how malicious, do not rise to the level of ``defacement,`` which pertains more to secure/static websites (think us govt homepages for instance).  i don't know whether he realised this, but in practical terms what casito said was misleading on both legal and practical grounds, a bluff if you will.  of course he didn't realise that i could see through his bluff, and when i calmly explained these two above points to him, he got really defensive and quite ``pissy,`` just as i'm sure he would in real life.  just between you and me, he just doesn't seem like a really ``cool kid.``  for you, however, i have the utmost respect, being a liberal arts professor in the only civilised part of the u.s. as far as i'm concerned.  however, you might want to hurry up presenting your evidence, since i'm once again leaving the country at 8:55 am tommorrow and won't be back until next month; and as i said on my user page, i won't be editing on wikipedia any more after i get back to work and my routine, etc.  but take care, don't take any crap from those snotty preppy know-it-all kids you have up there (and how would i know about that hmmmmm????) )!! `

>i don't want less taxes, i want a less shitty america.       once you start having 1k plus taken out in taxes on paychecks, this mentality changes. especially since you can't see fuck all what your taxes are going towards.      the founding fathers would've offed themselves for the greater good if they could see america now.


`  ==comment== i think it would be best for all involved to give missionary/retcon (i will use retcon because it is the oldest of the accounts) a chance to redeem himself, and for all parties to terminate the inquisition against him.  using a sockpuppet or changing to a different account to escape unwanted criticism is permitted at wikipedia.  if his actions had been limited to that, i would not have responded to tommstein's request at all as an ill-founded request.  however, what led me to respond were two factors: one, that retcon had fraudulently attempted to mislead people into believing he and missionary were different people, and two, that he created at least one impersonation account, impersonating a person who he was clearly at odds with.  in any case, retcon has acknowledged and apologized for his inappropriate acts; wikipedia's ``assume good faith`` policy all but requires to accept his apology and move on.  so let's please do so.  i'd especially call on  and  to lay off the rhetoric; it will not help defuse the situation.  personal attacks (such as  calling retcon a ``compulsive liar``) are neither helpful nor welcomed.  there is bad blood on both sides of this issue, and frankly i'd like to see y'all work this out on your own with civility, rather than escalating the situation to the point that intervention by the arbitration committee is required.    `


`   == needless deletion ==  somebody deleted my footnote on the guts and auron similarities. first off, they are far more profound than those between those and sanjuro. however, unlike sanjuro, which is an -internet rumor-, yoshinori kitase admitted in a 1997 famitsu article to being a big fan of ``berserk`` at that time, in and of itself a heavy influence of final fantasy vii and countless inspirations for other japanese creators/artists. to strike out my notes on guts and yet keep a completely baseless internet ``rumor`` is absurd. i'm not going to delete the yojimbo article, but i better see some explanations and fast. `

 please, this is not censorship. in fact, the usage of other languages is mentioned in the main article. if it were censorship, all matter pretaining to the other languages usage in malaysia would be removed. in fact, in the first paragragh, there are seven ways how to call malaysia in various languages and scripts.  :::: the official language box can only have malay because malay is the only official language. unlike india, south africa, or canada or singapore of which their constitutions say there are more than one official language, malaysian constitution explicitly says only malay is the official language. thus - only malay in the official language box. wikipedia's job is to spread information, not make new information. see wp:nor.  :::: for usual convention, see template_talk:infobox_country. for general rule of thumb on naming, see wikipedia:naming conventions (use english). in fact, if we were to follow wp's guideline tightly, the first paragragh shouldn't list the other six languages/scripts. an implicit compromise was made earlier on this if you cared to check the page history. if you push this, it's likely that, according to wp:ue, all other languages will be removed, undoing the implicit compromise.  :::: and for precedence from other article, see portal:montreal/discussions/english names/draft policy. also, wikipedia_talk:language_policy. see also united states of america - no spanish despite spanish is the second most spoken language in the us. how about indonesia? as for your precedence, could you point to any where the constitution says there's only one official language while there are many other major spoken languages that are included in the box?

 :::i am always skeptical about these 'naked spacewalks' for various reasons. they say our body is ~70% water, but that does not really paint an accurate picture. the reality is that we are more like soda pop in a bottle, where we have a certain amount of nitrogen, oxygen, and other trace gasses dissolved in our bloodstream at stp. the key here is the stp part. as with a bottle of soda, when the pressure is decreased, the gasses rapidly come out of solution, which is what produces the fizz. similarly, if your body went rapidly from stp to the vacuum of outer space, you would almost certainly experience a similar effect. to be blunt, your blood would quite literally boil and you would surly die of an aneurysm or internal bleeding from all the vessels which would be breached by the gasses trying to escape. about the closest i've seen to this being accurately portrayed is in the film event horizon, where it shows all the vessels on justin's body becoming visible as they rapidly expand when the airlock pressure is decreased. but still, it does not explain where the gas goes, which is the same problem in this film. it seems wholly impossible to survive such a drastic change in atmospheric pressure.

`::::::i don't understand your reference. while i admit that i consider certain races ``inferior`` (depending on how one defines the word ``inferior``), i certainly have no desire to wipe anybody out. i don't recall ever saying that i did, and perhaps more to the point, it was never my intention to use wikipedia as a soap box for my personal beliefs about race. i try to restrain myself from inserting personal bias when editing articles here, but it seems that editors with a far-left/marxist/liberal/jewish take on things make no effort to restrain themselves. nor do they have to, since to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever been banned from wikipedia for being a ``marxist troll`` or anything to that effect.   `

 2007 (utc)  , i really don’t care whether this article states that the suspect origins are sino-korean or not (largely because i think the theory is a whole bunch of korean nationalist propaganda). however, if you’re going to edit the article, at least use grammatical english. instead of writing: *on the other hand, some scholars have suspected that the real reason for the refusal may be japan’s worry about the possibility of finding evidence of elsewhere origins to the japanese imperial line therein. write: *on the other hand, some scholars have suspected that the real reason for the refusal may be japan’s worry about the possibility of finding evidence of the japanese imperial line’s suspected xenogenesis therein. “xenogenesis” comes from “xeno-”, a prefix meaning “foreign” or “alien” (like the “gai” in “gaikokujin”), + “genesis”, meaning “origin” or “creation” = “foreign origin”; it is mainly used in biology to mean something different, but i think the rarer usage will be understood here.  12:15, 1 february


`=removal from anti-semetic category=== *mel gibson is only human while mr. gibson did make wrong, anti-semetic comments, he did so drunk, and he does not speak openly about any kind of anti-semetic views when sober. he also does not advocate his views or pursues them past a drunken rant. i think he needs to be removed from wikipedia's anti-semetic category. what do you guys think.    ::he's an adult. the law doesn't make a distinction betwen words & acts said and committed when drunk and when sober; neither should we. he is quoted on a police report as making remarks that are undeniably anti semitic. therefore, he is anti-semitic.   :::like all material here, just provide sources saying that gibson is anti-semetic and you can add it in. thanks  ::::umm, the nyt quotes him as making comments about the ``fucking jews``. is this not a sufficient source for you?   :::::in which case, this little ditty from the article also seems to help...a prominent jewish leader calling him an anti-semite: in response, abraham foxman of the anti-defamation league, who was one of the passion'''s most vocal critics, released a statement saying that gibson's apology was ``unremorseful and insufficient`` and that the group hoped that ``hollywood now would realize the bigot in their midst and that they will distance themselves from this anti-semite.``  ::::::gibson said that he has disgraced himself and his family and he is sorry for what he did. what more do does foxman want? yes, and hollywood has such high standards to hold up...this is the kind of ammunition foxman craved as soon as he started criticizing the passion. i'm not anti-semetic in anyway, and gibson should be ashamed. i just don't like people being unfair. i also think the mugshot is unfair and i will be changing it.  ::::::::i agree that the mugshot may be unfair as a primary image for this article. but it should be included near the discussion of this incident.    ::::::the adl has been sued for defamation for unfairly accusing people of anti-semitism before and has been mired in a number of controversies. i would hardly consider them a reliable source.   :yeah, like george bush might get drunk and suddenly shout out ``i love islam!`` because when you're drunk you typically say the opposite of what you believe?    it's funny to read the arguments here about if mr. gibson is anti-semitic or not given the known views of his ``traditionalist`` catholic church. clearly he is anti-semitic, and in another time, he would probably say so ``proudly``. call a spade a spade, if it quacks, it’s a duck. mel gibson is anti-semitic. can there really be any question among intelligent people? and if this is so, than clearly it has a place in the article.   :please don't insult us with your damned sneering arrogance, jake b.  or some of us may argue that there is no question amongst ``intelligent people`` that many israelis and right-leaning jews amongst the diaspora are racists and gentile haters who campaign in a mccarthyist style (just look at the reaction to this case - utterly hysterical).  i tell you what: i can provide more evidence to support my assertion than you can to support yours (cf adl). and by the way, according to the adl every single gentile in the world who isn't an israel supporter is a jew hater and racist who should be condemned and ostracised, so quoting one of the leaders is like quoting hitler in an article on jews.  many gentiles see the adl as nasty, racist and very dangerous.  and by the way, compare gibson's comments with some of those posted by jews on the ha'aretz online forums: he's positively liberal compared to them (i quote from recent posts:  .....99.99% of arabs are terrorists [does this one sound familiar?].....let's just nuke them all and stop wasting our soldiers' lives.....you can't trust muslims to hold to peace.....mel gibson is a nazi.....''etc etc ad infinitum, plus hundreds of comments saying the civilians of the qana massacre got what they deserved.  try posting a comment there in which you ask for israel to be calm, not over-react, and spare civilians - without actually taking a side - and quickly and inevitably you'll be called a jew-hater, a

 :: the homeopathic view , the naturopathic view , the nutritional medicine view . they don't deny measles is infectious, but i'd like an explanation as to why you deny people those viewpoints on wiki?  


 ::hiv transmission does not have a constant level of risk per exposure.  some people are genetically resistant (e.g. ccr5_δ32ccr5-.ce.9432) as potential recipients, and some people are likely not to be very infectious even if infected (e.g. hla b*57).  in addition, acutely infected people are the most infectious, and people with genital ulcer disease are likely to be both high transmitters and particularly susceptible.  so, the risk depends dramatically on many variables.  in addition, it's known that the cumulative risk approaches only about 40% (in discordant couples), and the uninfected partners tend to show evidence of cellular immunity to hiv (suggesting exposure).

  very soon we all will find more, about who you are.      public statement by mark bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleagues  you continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the los angeles times. why? instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. you are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me, mark bellinghaus. i have never had a 'dispute' with brandon james, since i have not contacted him, as he claimed in the article published by the oc register. they also published other lies, which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. i will file a protest with wikipedia, because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander, character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes, the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. this article is literally a stage for book projects such as june dimaggio's and jeanne carmen's.  maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind delicious carbuncle?!  again, i knew that i would become the target of the criminals who i stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks, attached to the legacy of marilyn monroe. but i will use my clear and given right to defend what we, three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with.  the la times articles must be added to this article, and the citizen is a dead blog, which was a favor/favour  posted by a friend, this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up, of kenneth knoll, the friend and manager of the june dimaggio book project. she quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is not a press agency or journalist.  regarding the brandon james claims which you willingly added. i have never spoken to brandon james, ever since i was introduced to him and his mother in 2005. he followed me to every blog, every website. attacked us, hidden behind monikers.  what is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility.  it is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. who is behind this? we do know exactly who is and we already have taken action.  and that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past.  it has also to do with cyber bullying, since i am being portrayed as a monster. i am being compared to charles manson and berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in malaysia. these people want me to go the megan meier way. they have already told me to kill myself. not once, but twice. they have called me a 'pedophile' and other insults. they have claimed that i made bomb threats when i have never ever threatened anyone. at all. i have never extorted anyone. you people, hiding behind your funny and also so believable names, you know why you are doing this and why you are using wikipedia, to destroy my name, completely. when i protested on the 45th anniversary of marilyn monroe's death, outside the chapel, i had my reason. three people were threatened and harassed by the 'monroe 6 version 2007' gang of people who threatened me to 'come to my home, tie me on a chair, duct tape me and steal my collection. they were not shy to even include the aids infected blood by one of the members. one of the people who is part of this group is now hiding behind this wikipedia moniker and we positively have received confirmation, that this female from canada, a woman which i have never met in personis part of this gang of super obsessive fans who on top of this also have created, have thought out these many frauds, hoaxes, crimes.  i am asking you, that if you decide to keep this site up and going, not to use it to destroy our success in terms of our exposures. i never thought that the power of blog could bring down the biggest exhibition fraud in history, but it did.  success, so simple created and achieved naturally delivers a lot of haters. jealousy is one thing, but facts and achievements are another.  it is one thing to post hateful comments about someone and to claim that 'mark bellinghaus mentally ill' and other worse things, and to post these hater attacks with monikers such as all of these people do itin known lori drew manner. but it is unfair and it is also liable to post lies on a website, which is nothing else than the revenge of a group

`  licinius, the more you explain your position, the more i think you're reading something into the current wording that just plain isn't there. saying aussie rules is an australian variety of football does not say that it is more australian than ``gridiron`` (nfl is the competition, not the game!) is american. it doesn't say that australians haven't had great influence on rugby league. the descriptions of the sections don't need to be, and in fact shouldn't be in the same format, since the different groups are not exactly the same sort of groups. the different codes are grouped into sections based on their history and similarities between the codes. there are two very obvious big groups, both easily characterised by their ``ancestry`` - the kicking games descended from association rules and the carrying games descended from the rugby rules. the rest of the codes, all relatively minor in global terms, cannot be characterised by a single ancestry, and so shouldn't be. they are a group of games, some influenced by both soccer-type games and rugby school rules, with various influences within the group as well, that are most easily characterised by the fact that they are all australian or irish in origin. saying some of them are australian varieties of football is not saying the rugby codes are  ``unaustralian`` any more than calling gaelic football an irish variety implies that irish soccer players are not irish/gaelic!   `

`  ==another response from jmk==  thank you for finally looking into this.  do you think i would be so adamant if i had something to hide vis a vis the clone/impersonation issue?  i will be very curious to see what your findings show, as i have my suspicions, but i will keep them to myself for now.  as i have repeatedly stated, the *only* anonymous edits i made were after my editing privileges were blocked, and then only to correct misinformation in the farmer article, all of which has since been re-inserted by wyss herself.  you're right, all i wanted was accuracya simple review of my very first post to wyss' talk page will show (despite my improper posting etiquette, for which i have repeatedly apologized) that all i asked her to do was fact-check.  i am well aware of the rashomon like qualities of attempting to discern the truth about frances farmer.  that indeed is why the subtitle to my article ``shedding light on shadowland`` is indeed called the truth about frances farmer.  that in turn is why my research has been used by a&e; biography, npr, the washington post, and, hilariously, the magazine wyss apparently thinks discredits me, 'american atheist.'  if you read conrad goeringer's article in 'american atheist' you will find that i am his major source of information and, indeed, there is a whole secondary article about me and my findings vis a vis the false lobotomy allegations.  what bothers me about all of this is not the block (though wyss says it's easy to get rescinded, i have yet to receive even a hint of how to do that, but that truly is not important to me), but wyss' repeated assertions that i have sinister motives and, more importantly, have cloned her id and/or impersonated her.  in terms of my motives, i have for over 20 years worked diligently to rid the world of misinformation about frances farmer, and i have been lauded internationally in the press and broadcast media for my attempts.  how is that sinsister?  in terms of the cloning/impersonation, what more can i say?  i have asked repeatedly for someone to do something technical to prove i didn't do it.  it seems that wyss has had frequent run-ins with others, and perhaps i am the unwitting recipient of some pent-up frustration on her part.  as i have come to surmise, i am probably at least twice as old as most of you, and i am willing to cut you ``kids`` (joke) some slack, but i want these false allegations to stop and i am asking again for someone to do an ip trace and consclusively state publicly to wyss and everyone involved that i had nothing to do with this clone id/impersonation affair.`

`  == creation and destruction ==  i wanted to respond earlier, but i wasn’t sure if i should ever address you again, because you seemed very offended.  but i find you an interesting subject.  you’re a computer programmer like me, (but more advanced), you have a semblance of devotion, as far as i can tell, and you like kjv like me.  if i have offended you, then i hope you will accept my apology.  the bible does say a lot of things about the motivations of people, and i really didn’t intend to direct any verses at you personally.  i really want to have a prophet's eye view of the human race.  when i saw the discussion i noted that evidence was being given by both sides, and i felt a desire to step outside of that perspective for a bit and give my own testimony of how the lord has led in my life concerning these issues.  since the time i wrote that i have had a fascination to study creation science, and i have had some overwhelming discoveries; treasures which i would like to share.  matthew 13:52  then said he unto them, therefore every scribe [which is] instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.  before i began to gather research, i suspected that there was already tons of evidence that would easily bury the evolution theory because it is a man-made theory designed by atheists to conveniently do away with moral responsibility to an intelligent creator.  i realized that adolf hitler was huge fan of evolution and thereby thought he was doing a good thing for mankind by eliminating the jews, (but he only killed ~6 million).  next on his list was the blacks.  his intention was to take over the whole world and progressively eliminate “inferior” races.  of course there have been many other attempted genocides in the cause of progressing humanity by eliminating “weaker” races.  some people may still sympathize with this cause.  we would call these racists and neo-nazis.    *“at some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace, the savage races throughout the world.”  charles darwin, the descent of man, chapter 3 and world book encyclopedia 1852, p. 336 *“thus from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of higher animals, directly follows.”  charles darwin the origin of species… p. 243 *“the standard of intelligence of the average adult negro is similar to that of the eleven-year old youth of the species homo sapiens.”  henry fairfield osborn – outspoken evolutionist and curator of the american museum of natural history, new york *“no rational man, cognizant of the facts, believes that the average negro is the equal, still less the superior, of the white man.”  thomas huxley (known as darwin’s bulldog) 1871 *here’s a “theistic” evolutionist: “the black people of australia, exactly the same race as the african negro, cannot take in the gospel… all attempts to bring them to a knowledge of the true god have as yet failed utterly... poor brutes in human shape… they must perish off the face of the earth like brute beasts”  kingsley c. sermons on natural subjects sermon xli pp. 414-17, 1886, charles kingsley, an anglican priest who promoted darwin.  a lot of people seem to feel more free if they convince themselves there is no creator, but that people have evolved and just make their own gods and religions. * ``with this single argument the mystery of the universe is explained, the deity annulled, and a new era of infinite knowledge ushered in.”  ernst haeckel (“the riddle of the universe,” 1899, p. 337.) (this guy must have been high on pcp or something.  the theory he was explaining assumed that living cells are very simple.  this was before molecular biology.) * “i suppose the reason we leaped at the origin of species was because the idea of god interfered with our sexual mores.” thomas huxley * “i had motives for not wanting the world to have meaning; consequently assumed it had none, and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption.  for myself, as no doubt for most of my contemporaries, the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation. the liberation we desired”  aldous huxley  but i’ve already explained why fallen man would want such a thing, and at the start i suspected, though i had not done so much research yet, there was already overwhelming evidence to verify the biblical account of creation and the flood.  discussing the evidence may persuade some, but never all.  jesus made it plain that no amount of evidence will persuade those that are not willing to be persuaded. *''“if

legally, there are no rules which state any geographical or political requirements which a state has to meet in order to join the schengen area (there are such criteria for joining the eu, but this is a different matter). the only possibility to join the schengen zone would be to enter into a treaty with the eu, which includes a clause that schengen-related eu law would be applicable in the associated non-eu state. the associated state would only have the right to be consulted. thus, the u.s. would have to accept each and every majority (!) decision taken in brussels whether citizens of this or that country would need a visa for entry into the area or not. and the u.s. would have to accept that every third-country national holding a residence title of a schengen state could enter the u.s. without even being checked. to bil: guadeloupe and french guiana are not inside the schengen area because this would e.g. require france to equip the complete rain forest border between french guiana and suriname, brasil etc. with high-tech infrared sensors which would detect every monkey which is crossing the border - just in order to avoid id checks on flights between there and europe. i can understand why they do not invest any money into this.

of ancient halikarnassos suggest that the city was extensively planned by mausolus during his reign as dynast/satrap.  he moved his dynastic seat from mylasa to halikarnassos and unified the whole pennisula in the greek model.  this reconstitution included the mausoleum in the centre of the city, adjacent to the agora - the most prominent place in the polis.  as such it is likely that mausolus planned the monument as a heroon, a shrine to himself as founder of halikarnassos reconstituted; so when pliny talks about the artists and sculptures employed to work

`  some historical info about the region of alattyán:  the town is in the region ``jaszag`` and its name comes from the people called ``jasz``. jasz people were originally sarmatian, they were still speaking their unique language until 14th century. sarmatians were a coalition of nomadic tribes and they invaded europe from the north of black sea. most of the scientists believe that king arthur legend was revealed after sarmatians. today the only sarmatian people left is ossetians (descendants of alans) living in the north caucasus.   in history there were three main tribes, alans, roxalans and iasyges (the last one is actually our jasz people) and they were speaking almost the same language. no written record left from the historical jasz language, except one example. within this example jasz prince salutates hungarian king and this salute is still easily understood by modern ossetian.  there is a strong ground for king arthur theory, as 5.500 iasyges cavalrymen were sent to north britain by romans to defend the hadrian wall against local tribes.  regards,  respendial`

`  (deindent) not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. these are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives.  the number  ...9997 in archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the ``largest prime`` in ludwig's order on the plutonian integers. you would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. so maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. so maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. maybe not. i don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. it's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. the methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency.   the reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are plutonian, the real numbers are only ``finitely`` wide. normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. unfortunately, plutonium's ``z`` is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from z-> digits. in this view z is larger than any sequence (the integers are ``uncountable``). so the real numbers have ``gaps`` which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. but large integers don't have reciprocals in plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences:  numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit.  so he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the ``adic integers`` which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the ``real numbers`` which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number.  the reason archimedes plutonium keeps working on the riemann hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. this is because he can ask questions like ``if i choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do i get a prime number?`` those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). he probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? he also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. these last two statements are both based on my own thinking. he might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, i don't know for sure.  look, i am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. but recognize that archimedes plutonium is to cranck science as isaac newton is to mainstream science. he has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. `

(insiders would recognize berry knoll as the ``juniper-covered hill south of town`` (colorado city, arizona/hildale, utah...) '' ``said to be the site for the temple the polygamous church had hoped to construct....`` one day.``)banking on heaven: ``in the flds (fundamentalist latter day saints), women are chattel and young boys are kicked out so older polygamous men can have sex with young girls. everybody does what they’re told, because the prophet, warren jeffs, is god [...]]``flds 101: ``the flds 'yearn for zion,' to live in a society free from sin and contention, where all things are held in common without jealousy  a heaven on earth. as the flds leadership continued to prophesy that the end of the world was quickly approaching, they taught the people that wickedness needed to be purged from their society. jeffs taught, 'one or two covenant breakers can cause the lord to stop blessing this people. as long as we have evil doers among us, the lord's blessings will be withheld. zion must be pure. we can't have evil people among the priesthood for the lord to appear and bless us like he would like to. be this a warning.' (w.s.j. 12/26/95) jeffs laid the doctrinal groundwork to justify a cleansing of the flds. their theology teaches that an ancient city lead by a prophet named enoch, was taken up into heaven because of their righteousness. the flds believe they can be taken up too as the wicked world is destroyed.``[... ... ``yearning for zion,`` a hymn by w.s. jeffs; 3rd verse]:imagine the people of enoch of old, trained in the order of heaven/ a beautiful city the lord called his own and forever made his abode/ coming to join with the zion on earth when finally the earth finds its rest/ a kingdom established in celestial laws, a people the lord can accept/ a new jerusalem it will be, a land of refuge, a city of peace [ . . . ]`

`   == napoleon zervas == :: dear helladios can you stop deleting my input. you have no right to censore someone elses opinion. you are not god. napoleon zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the cham albanians  ``zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the german occupation authorities surfaced`` this quote came from wikepedia's biography of napoleon zervas. other sites are more explicit and call him a nazi collaborateur. nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the nazi's. however it was zervas thet collaborated with the nazi's that expelled them. shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. there is a un resolution which asks the greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.the rest of this article is lame. i miss the following:   copyright © 2006 illyrians.org. during the conference of ambassadors in london in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the greek state despite the fact that people of the southern epirus were albanians of orthodox and the muslim faith. while the orthodox albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the greek government.  chams who lived in southern epirus (chameria or thesprotia as it is called by the greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in europe at the end of the second world war. the cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the european continent. statistical yearbook of the greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 chams lived in chameria region in greece at that time.  as a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 albanian muslims were violently expelled from the chameria region, and sought refuge in the republic of albania, where they still live. today, there are 150.000 members of this population in albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. on the other hand, current number of cham albanians living in greece is estimated at around 100.000. yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in greece. to cite but one example, they can speak albanian only in their homes.  the population of chameria has always been ethnically albanian: - a lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that chameria had been populated by albanians. even the greek historian herodotus underscored this fact in his book historias and called albanians of the chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - the census held by the turkish administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim albanians in the region. the demographic map of the british military mission sent to the british government in london indicates that on the eve of the second world war, 75% of chameria's population was albanian. - the pro-greek historian spiro muselimi, in his book ``historical sight through thesprotia``, edited in joannina on 1974, wrote that ``the bishop of thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of bible into albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in greek`` .  the greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the albanians of muslim faith. the racial assault on chameria's muslim albanians began to be first applied at the end of the second world war, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious general napoleon zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.  on june 27, 1944, greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. the terror committed against this population was beyond description. it included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. more than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of paramithy, on tuesday, june 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of st.bartholomeus day for the whole chameria.  during the june 1944-march 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in filat, 192 people were killed in gumenica, 626 persons were killed in margellic and parga. there were hundreds of other missing persons. in the same period, as a result of greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the albanian population of chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses a

`    the problem being, my friend, that you are not a specialist in that field, and have been posting for over a month in ybm's private forums, and are a very big fan and socket puppet of his. the second problem being that your extensiv scientifical ``evidencies``, well supplied above, contain absolutly nothing who don't have been mentioned, and i should say ``supposed``, earlier, already at the beginning of 2004, and abundently refutated since, and that all those counterproofs dismantled all the attacks from the scientifical part of the accusators, and that it was then agreed that it was more a question of specialisation differences than of direct misunderstanding of existing theories, or gross ignorancies of basic physic. thats what make cosmology a specific part of advance physic. your field being not cosmology nor higher physic nor theoretical physic, it will have been better if you had first consulted with a ``collegue`` from the department of theoretic physic, before you posted here, or even before you made up your opinion about the bogdanovs work. you made already plenty of that kind of mistakes also in the french wiki about this case, and no, we are not impress at your ability to repeat yourself and others statements without correction alredy brought by other scientifics.  links:  [URL]  [URL] [URL]  [URL] [URL]  [URL]  [URL]   [URL]   `


`, 20 february 2007 (utc)  you know, my friend derek wilkinson owns the 1st edition of beauty & the beast. when i watched my copy, i found out it was the 2nd edition & i thought it was the only edition ever made. so, 1 day when i went to his house, i saw the trailer of sleeping beauty, then it said the ``special previews`` bumper & thought to myself, ``where's the pinocchio trailer? did they cut it out? is this a 2nd version from 1993? my copy of batb has that trailer.`` i never saw the end of the 1st edition, but once marco on this website told me he owned it, he told me that the pinocchio trailer was still on there, but it was at the end, with the ``& now, here are the 2 special previews from walt disney home video!`` bumper & the 101 dalmatians trailer after that. then, i figured out that's how they originally made it & that my copy was the 2nd edition from 1993, when pinocchio came out. i saw on the page of fortunecity that it dtopped out in 1993, but i wasn't sure when in 1993. then i found that my copy was from 1993, when pinocchio came out, so i was sure it dropped out when aladdin came out & was sent back to the disney vault. btw, since you told me that you saw the 2nd edition of beauty & the beast & you have a column on your user page called ``videos i've seen``, you could list down you saw that tape. also, you might be able to know this, but if both editions of those tapes, along with 101 dalmatians & the great mouse detective have an aladdin trailer, why doesn't the 1992 vhs of the rescuers have an aladdin trailer?  21:22`


`   the article states that ``montenegrin and serb identities are not exclusive``, but this is not true. they are exlusive acording to the constitution of montenegro, the constitutional charter of serbia and montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. these are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). on the other hand, it is true that a number of serbs and montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as ``montenegrin and serb identities are not exclusive``. many montenegrins do not feel to be serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. you can not force national groups to ``be serb`` if they do not feel so and never declare as such.  ``however the number of montenegrins does seem to be in steep decline since the introduction of the category by the communists on the 1948 census`` seems to imply that the communist regime declared the nationality of citizens in polls. this is not true, as citizens declared their nationaility in polls, individually. in fact, the communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. if it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the ``serbian ruling dynasties in the pre world war ii yugoslavia banned montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'montenegrin'`` this is as true as the communist quirp, as the montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before world war ii.  the article states that moc was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. the moc has been legally registered in montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of montenegro and in line with the laws in montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the moc page on wikipedia. the moc church is called the montenegrin orthodox church in its formal registration in montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. the church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920.  the article does not claim that moc is a major branch of eastern orthodoxy outside montenegro.   the statement ``over 74% of montenegrins are eastern orthodox christians, most of whom belong to the serb orthodox church`` is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. one may say truthfully say that ``most montenegrins are eastern orthodox christians, most of whom belong to the serb orthodox church``, but a large number of montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. being a montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of eastern orthodox christians. sorry, this is the 21st century.  you can not just delete the fact that moc followers claim that ``all of the existing churches in montenegro were once part of an autonomous montenegrin orthodox church that was abolished following the union with serbia in 1918.`` this is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in montenegro by the moc, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of soc. if we put only one viewpoint in ``its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other orthodox church`` it is not balanced. also, the statement ``its following is small to the point of non-existence`` needs to be based on fact not fancy. do you have an official census of followers, or is this based on the fact that you are a believer of the soc?  the sentence ``the validity of the referendum was not confirmed by international observers as the allegedly free and democratic vote, in fact took place during wartime in the former yugoslavia.`` is true. so i leave it. of course, i agree to change ``international`` into ``osce, eu and us`` - as the referendum may have had international monitoring from cuba, iraq, north korea, byelorussia, and russia.  - user .`

the thing with sexuality is that its not a choice. you cant help the way you feel. your mum might not understand, but she isnt going to force you to do anything.       i mean sure you could just "give in" but thats no better than when a gay man would get married and have kids because thats what society expects.       i'm 38 and though i wouldnt say i'm asexual, i have no desire to settle down, get married and have kids. even just having sex is an effort. my sisters have had kids so my parents do have grandkids, but the expectation was there until i made it clear i was happy to be single for the rest of my life.       regardless of what the expectation is, you should do only what makes you comfortable.

establishing and maintaing a business is a difficult and arduous task, that requires massive dedication and a large investment of time, money and effort. start-up business owners can't just lay back and do meaningless paperwork while the profits roll in; they have to work their arses off to get their businesses off the ground.      if a business becomes successful, and they can begin to afford to hire someone else to do some of the work, then they have earned the right to own their "means of production". but even the owners of large businesses often still have to work hard to ensure that their business does not collapse. the fact that they are no longer physically labouring is irrelevant; it is a job that requires skill, experience and dedication- and one that most people are unable to fill.      the customer of the business pays money to the business owner to receive the desired product, and the worker receives a certain amount of money to operate the means of production that the business owner has worked to obtain. any profit that the business owner gains is his payment for the work that he has put in.

`  sandpiper is right and habj, too. there is definitely an error in the text concerned. it should read ``knut tordsson (bonde)`` if using the names in swedish. neither carl, son of canute, nor his father canute, son of tord (no english version of that one is known to me), ever used the bonde surname. it became a surname, and that of one of sweden's longest living ``noble`` families (still going strong) around the end of the 16th century. only the nobility started using surnames then. no one (excuse me for shouting) had any surnames until then in sweden, though some regular soldiers had nicknames to distinguish them from all the other anders anderssons. 80% of the population had no surnames at all, other than new patromymics inherited every generation, until they began adopting them in the 1880's. women had no legal names at all until 1901. oh, by the way, ``scholarly convention`` in this case means an attempted bluff for the sake of argument, but nothing factual whatsoever.`

not to raise an argument for an all beef diet (why you would choose beef over chicken breast or fish, which are infinitely more healthy is beyond me), but there's at least some merit to a low-carb diet, mostly because it tends to just knock out your appetite making it easier to consume less calories.       i think the big thing about fruit is while it is good for you, it tends to tack on more sugar to the already sugar heavy american diet. if you're woofing down a syrup-laden dole fruit cup after some chicken nuggets and a coke, you're hardly doing yourself any favors.        the cheese and egg thing, they're just really low in carbs according to google. usually low carb diets keep you at like 30-35g of carbs a day, and you'd have to eat over a dozen boiled eggs in day to come close to that. not that you'd want all that cholesterol anyway.

there are 7 billion people on this planet. billions upon billions of women and young women have given birth. it's what happens. bringing a child into this world under less than desirable circumstances is not the end of the world. i know a woman who gave birth at 15, became a dental hygienist and took care of her child. was it the perfect situation? of course not, but she is a good woman with a good life. if you end up not being pregnant then maybe get on some type of birth control . if you are pregnant just remember a child is for life and does bring a type of love you only get from being a mother. think long and hard about abortion and what that may bring to your life as well.

  : it appears that cailil is the only person taking issue with a comments and criticisms section. it is pretty much default procedure for editors to place a comments and criticisms section in articles, particularly regardind articles about corporations. i think cailil's abuse of admin power is apparent in this case. the fact that he threatens to tag anyone who replaces the comments and criticisms section as a vandal is obvious, and can be seen as an abuse of admin power, voting is the generally accepted way of resolving these disputes yet he has completely ignored this and used his admin power to forward his personal agenda surrouding this article. this here is exactly what is wrong with wikipedia. admin abuse is about the only flaw in the open source concept and project that is wikipedia. more often admins are seen as using their powers to strike back for bruised egos, or protection of their non-neutral point of view. wikipedia is flat out an open source project, and while the policies are generally adhered to, even jimmy wales has left stuff alone when the community demanded it, no matter if it adhered to the policies. the comments and criticisms section needs to be put back into this article, i would do it myself but i cannot find it in the history section. if someone finds it but is afraid to replace it due to cailil's threats link it to me in my user talk page. if he wants to fight with someone i will fight him, and will gladly strike back by reporting him as abusing his admin powers.

`   ::the minute you said this you lost all credibility,   ``flight 30 is notable because a big hole appeared in the aircraft, flight 9336 is notable because there were injuries``(earaches)  ``as for damage to an object or damage to people, i think most people would say that physical injuries to people are far more serious than repairable damage to an aircraft.`` (yeah an explosion that rips a hole in the side of an aircraft is much less serious than earaches.)  ``you keep ignoring the potentially serious injuries that cause 26 people to be sent to hospital.`` (are you an attorney harry?? i bet there is some lawyer getting ready to file a lawsuit against ryanair using them exact same words, permanent ear damage, maybe the pilot should have told them to suck on some candy or chew gum before he started the descent!!!)  as someone who claims to know so much about aviation, you might want to acquaint yourself with [URL] if an incident is a c (crash) or an a (accident) on that site, it is serious enough to be considered for inclusion. (ha, it still makes me laugh everytime i read that comment)  ``it is (at www.avherald com, which takes it beyond the tabloid journalism and classifies it as an ``accident`` rather than an incident) so there is no reason why this adequately sourced addition should be removed, especially when the dangerous approaches paragraph remains.`` (oh yeah the avherald, there website is truly amazing and the classification system is beyond belief. everybody knows that a decompression is much more serious than pilots attempting to fly an ifr approach when the ils is out of service with low clouds and not realizing it until they broke out of the clouds a few hundred feet and realized they were already half way over the runway, going to fast, and tehn  and not realizing it or a pilot that instead of doing a missed approach, banks the aircraft hard to the right at low altitude and proceeds to circle back to the airport a few hundred feet above the ground a low speed)   ``nothing wrong with the plane??? planes just routinely depressurise for no reason do they?``(not everyday but probably one of the more common events, its amazing that we don't have thousands of dead people every year because decompression is such a serious incident in your opinion)  also as someone who claims to know about aviation, you should know that rapid decompression and descent can lead to serious inner ear problems. the injuries may have been ``all in their heads``, but that is because it's where their inner ears are. the were no injuries in the qantas 30 incident. despite being more spectacular, it was not as serious as the ryanair incident, (i think you are confusing rapid decompression with explosive decompression, also the pilots get warnings and the masks drop before pressurization altitude gets too high so essentially they are most likely down below 10,000feet before anything serious can happen. but your so right that the quantas incident is less serious, that is why the next day the ryanair plane was flying again and the qantas flight was getting the hole in the side of fuselage fixed)   harry more people like you should for the faa, it would be much easier ``yeah i know i was drunk while i was flying, but nobody got hurt.``   `

`suggested changes to copy of article ``ballenstedt`` in english. ``ballenstedt is a town, which is located on the northern edge of the eastern harz mountains.  it belongs to the queslinburg district (kreis) in saxony-anhalt.  a roman-style road leads into ballenstedt. ``in ballenstedt there is a castle which was the seat of the ascanian family.  the founder was albert i (of brandenburg)who, in 1157, was the first markgraf of the brandenburg march (mark).  albert i, like his father, held the title graf von ballenstedt albert i's grave lies within the ascanian monastery in ballenstedt.  in the city park, a monument to albert is located, built from frithjof meussling. ``ballenstedt is noted for more than its cemetary.  the former house of luegelgens next to the castle (schlosss)serves today as a museum.  also the castle (schloss) is used as a museum.  the ballenstedter schloss theater is the oldest theatre in saxony-anhalt.  after the change of 1989, the first democratically selected mayor of ballenstedt, wolfgang gurke, changed the destiny of the city considerably. ``likewise for many years the prominent family kiep resided, whose members include ottl kiep (diplomat) and walther leisler kiep.``  `

`  perhaps the ``self-advertising`` character of this article would be somewhat abrogated by a little criticism.  in this article [URL] he writes:    ``remember, one of the rules when it comes to technology is moore's law, that the computing power that can fit on a microchip doubles just under every two years. if this trend holds true, as it has for the past several decades, australia's force 2030 will be operating in a world in which our information technology will be a billion times more powerful than today. notably, this isn't an amorphous ``billion``, as dr evil would pontificate in the movie austin powers, but literally taking the power of our current computers multiplying it by 1,000,000,000. but imagine if that law doesn't hold true, and moore's law works out at only a hundredth of its past pace. then the computers that power robots in the era of force 2030 will only be a mere 1,000,000 times more powerful.``   ironically, his grasp of numeric quantities is probably even further off than dr. evil's.  if ``computing power`` doubles every two years for twenty years, the resulting increase in computing power would be just 1024 times more powerful (2^10 = 1024 see [URL] not ``a billion``.  and if computing power increased at 1/100th of its current pace (i.e. instead of doubling, increasing at one-one-hundredth of 2 = 0.02 per annum), the resulting increase in power would be just 1.02^10: computers would be 1.21899442 times as powerful as those today.  all this would probably be more relevant if he even managed to get moore's law correct in the first place.  moore's law did not relate to ``computing power`` but to the density of transistors in a given area.  in practical terms, a doubling of the number of transistors /= doubling of computing power... so we certainly aren't going to facing armies of terminators, a ``billion`` times more computationally powerful than the robots of today!!!   i shudder to think that this is the quality of strategic advice being given to the highest eschalons of the us government!!!  0:20 (utc) 11 may 2009`

`race & genetics== addressing crusio's comment, there are markers that could be looked for. for example is the pcsk9 allele, this is all in the context that certain races are more susceptible to certain diseases. certain races also respond differently to medications. certain allels are prevalent in only certain races (although there is race mixing as immigration and such, the alleles are still passed on)  i'm sure you all know i'm alluding to nitromed's bidil.  in this case, bidil seems to help heart failure in african americans more then other races. should we not research into this?   would it be racist to give african americans (in the article, they were ``self identified black patients``) this medicine?  i think a lot of the stigma around nazi's and eugenics and racism has halted the academic freedom into research into this matter. people needs to understand that as an academic, one must have an academic view on things. if a particular drug helps a particular race, then why not use it? but we can't choose what results produces, we must accept them in order to change. ie. if a particular gene/allele is present in one race that's lacking in others, i must acknowledge the difference in order to help develop methods to create possible genetic cures.  to turn a blind eye to this is not only limiting academic freedom, but is an injustice to humanity as a whole. an example is seen in the case of lysenkoism, which caused famines that killed millions.    == `

  you have spouted out a lot of childish canards, immature insults and infantile language to back up your position; however you have failed to achieve your goal. your ad hominen attacks against the web site solargeneral.com only clarify your political position of jewish ethnocentrism and your bias against web sites which speak honestly about judaism, jewfish extremism and jewish supremacism. unfortunately for you, insults have no value in an adult forum for discussing how we can improve the quality of entries in wikipedia.  how could i possibly be promoting a web site if i am adding direct links to the web site files that serve as nothing else but to drain the web site of its precious bandwidth resources? i did not link to web pages where these books could be downloaded; instead i put direct download paths to these books which give no ability for the person who downloads these books to surf around the site in question.  your jewish anger and hate, jewish ethnocentrism and jewish extremism have no place in wikipedia and it is truly sad that such outdated and antiquated belief systems are allowed to corrupt the quality and integrity of wikipedia. get over yourself.

`  == god created everything in six days and rested on the seventh ==   the article states that ``the text of genesis relates that god created everything in six days and rested on the seventh.``  and i agree if you do a casual reading of english translations.  however, some commentaters, notably e. w. bullinger, argue that the six days describes the creation of the new world after the ``world that was``.  i have researched and understand bullinger's argument.  i will present it here.  niv:  :ge 1:1  in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. 2  now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the spirit of god was hovering over the waters.  kjv:  : ge 1:1  in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth. 2 and the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters.  now, the english word ``formless`` in the niv and the english words ``without form`` in the kjv are translations of the hebrew word tohu, g/k number h9332 and strong's number h8414.  the strongs concordance lists one of the meanins of toho as ``to lie waste`` or simply ``waste.``    likewise, the english word ``empty`` in the niv and the english word ``void`` in the kjv is translated from the hewbrew bohu, g/k number h983 and strong's number h922.  strong's concordance provides one of the definitions of bohu as ruin.  consequently, it is argued that the verses could be considered something like ~ ``in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. 2  now the earth was waste and ruin, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the spirit of god was hovering over the waters.``  furthermore, bullinger's observations continue to, and link 2pe3:6, which states (kjv) 2pe3:6 ``whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.``  bullinger believes that this is a reference to ge1:1-2, and not the flood during noah's time.  he concludes with ``the creation in eternity past, to which all fossils and remains belong.``  (companion bible, page 3).  consequently, the articles should include, in my opinion, the fact that some theologians reject the young earth on literal grounds.  see the bullinger's side notes [].  also, a quick google search will show that other literal interpreters [] with bullinger.    to summarize:  the article should be changed to reflect the fact that some literal interpreters of the bible do not think the earth is roughly 6000 years old.   vacuous poet`

`just to add kansas bear.when i said:   ``you made the elementry mistake of calling it a treaty when it was in fact a congrass``   is because as you left out as usual my post in which you regarded the three deligations as having been pressent at the treaty o arass with papal meditiation.the treaty of arass was a private treaty only between the deligations of burgundy and france and made a military alliance in 1439.again we are debatting on the burgundian recognition stop changing the subject.you clearly are giving fallactious statements and i feel your posts are utterly questionable.if you happend to remeber a month ago we both agreed the congrass and treaty of arass were different.i corrected your statement when you regarded the three deligations as bieng pressent at the treaty of arass.p.s stop with your childish personal attacks.i aqsked you to give sources regarding that burgundy didnt recognize henry as king of france but you give refs regarding the treaty of arass and mixing up the posts.if you cant handle the fact that burgundy recognised henry as king of france then i have already reverted you on the dual-monarchy article.you should be ashamed of your fallactious remarks nd utterly questionable unsourced facts      `

  in response to matthew: then rename the section and add more notes. it's possible. you just have to (um, what's that word? oh yeah...)try!   it wouldn't hurt you if that section were up. you didn't waste your time typing it nor did you seem to plan wasting your time with it. so let me handle that part.  


`     the usa under the confederation may have had the same name as the modern-day usa, but it was not the modern-day usa. the usa (confederation) and the usa (union, or also called ``nation``), are different entities. the argument can be made that while the usa (confederacy) was a ``firm league of friendship`` among a number of ``free and independent states,`` the usa (union) was a separate political entity that, although it replaced the usa league, was something completely different. saying that the articles was the first constitution of the usa, and then providing a link to the (modern-day) united states, is misleading. my point: the article as it currently stands is incorrect because it asserts that the articles was the constitution of a union that did not yet exist, although the political body in place did have the superficial similarity of having the same name.  and the verifiable reliable sources which support my interpretation are the declaration of independence and the articles of confederation and perpetual union.  perhaps i didn't express my convictions eloquently enough to be understood, since the differences are not easy to distinguish. if i'm not clear in my explanation, point to the unclear parts and ask me to reexplain.`

` :thank you for your answer. i am reading the article on hessen-darmstadt (redirects to it) and it says ``in 1871, it became a constituent state of the german empire.`` so that's not sovereign anymore, anything before that until 1806 maybe, but not after the founding of the german empire, all state monarchies lost their sovereignty. here is also a list of all the states category:states of the holy roman empire. imo they only had sovereignty between the end of the holy roman empire from 1806 until the foundation of the second reich in 1871. the only monarchies that retained their sovereignty were austria-hungary, luxembourg, and liechtenstein, all others were incorporated and became mere states of the german empire.  `

 if you want to leave the article a bunch of lies , controlled by a child. okay . you better be able to prove what you say. it is not vandalising when i correct lies. you better contact someone who knows the truth before printing lies. there was never a porsche motor in a yugo, etc. i guess this 13 year old knows more about cars than i do.


good, carry on and good luck.      let the lawyer look after it, take the personal feelings out of it. live your life, be there for your kids. i can't go back to check, are they living with you? sounds like they should be.


yes, i remeber you warmly.  did the personal attack against you, in the case you mention, involve a body part of yours having been selected for scurrilous comment, as is the case above?  do you not realise that anything of that sort is a criminal matter in ordinary life (a person can go to jail in the united states for something that)?  i do question motives behind actions of wikipedia administrators where i do not see official policies and guidelines supporting them; and i expect user:bishonen’s answers: those can be given, i may be proven wrong, and the matter might end with an apology.  there should be more questioning, not less, however, if problems like those you yourself had suffered are to be rectified systemically.  there is a world of difference between, on the one hand, a personal attack, such as might involve a reference to the victim’s body, and, on the other hand, an attack on abuse of authority or an attack on the wrongfulness of an action.  one thing that user:bishonen and user:charles matthews simply have no right to do is continuously to cyber-stalk me with intent to harass with unexplained reverts, etc., and when questioned refuse to engage.  interlocutors might be chosen at liberty when he or she opens the door of his or her house: here such liberty does not exist, and questions from all quarters must be answered as a matter of official policy.  thank you for writing to me in what obviously are very difficult times.  — prof02

`  : and just for the record, i (unsurprisingly) sincerely belief that not much new technology will come out of newman's invention. even leaving all the contradictions to physics aside, there is a much more pragmatic argument: any electric motor design which ``only`` cut backs losses by 50% (going from 90% to 95% efficency) would be of outmost commercial importance. you would be able to go (with bodyguards and lawyers if you prefer) into the development centers of siemens, emd, or bombardier, demonstrate your working prototype and leave as a very rich man. :    ::ri^2 = heat losses ::ri*(meters/ohm) = current times distance = current momentum ::current momentum can be determined by integrating current along the length of wire (with dl as the derivative length).  it can be found in the biot-savart law. ::to maximize current momentum / heat losses, the following should be maximized: ::ri*(meters/ohm) / ri^2 = (meters/ohm)/i = cross-sectional area of wire / (resistivity * current) ::but current momentum produces the magnetic field, the square of which is proportional to its energy.  so to maximize the energy of the magnetic field / heat loss. ::r^2*i^2*(meters/ohm)^2 / ri^2 = r*(meters/ohm)^2 = distance^2/ohm ::just use a longer wire! i guess the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy, causing electromagnetic radiation. even the simple movement of a charge can cause a magnetic field, causing acceleration, and therefore radiation! if the wire is so short, that is like shorting the battery (e.g. connecting them in series) and not using the charges to your advantage.    ok, so i'd like to start by saying that i may more or less completely misunderstand you, but (apart from a very good remark about the mass to energy conversion), your statements look rather heterodox to me. granted, newman would have to have found new physics to make his machine work, but i assume we are discussing textbook physics and ee in this side note. specifically: * it's not the resistive (heat) losses (or other losses) which bound the electric motor's efficency to 100%. even using a supraconducting coil and everything you wish, you won't get above 100%  the counter voltage induced by the rotation will make the input power needed to sustain rotation equal to mechanical work done. * equal amount of copper will give you motors of equal parameters, only with voltages and currents scaled in different, compensating directions. e.g. both thse setups will give the same magnetic field and motor operation: ** 1 meter of 0,15 mm diameter copper wire (about 1 ω) at 4 v and 4 a (stall current) and ** 4 meter of 0,075mm diameter copper wire (about 16 ω) at 16 v and 1 a (stall current) * but i agree with your guess that the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy. every time some energy is transported away from a system, the system loses mass according to e=mc²  in most cases an unmeasurable low amount. also if you temporarily attach strings to the oppositely charged bodies, you can extract mechanical energy while reducing their distance, exactly that amount of mass will be lost (if we keep the system isolated, its total mass stays the same, e.g when letting the two bodys clonking together, the energy will first be converted to kinectic energy, then to heat, and both contribute to the mass of the system, which in effect stays constant). but in a motor the movement is periodic, so there is nothing in sight which can result in mass loss  unless some copper atoms are vanishing mysteriously or sort of transmutate into something other than normal copper. ouch. not exactly briefly. sorry.   `

`  == unsourced material ==  the following is unsourced information:  *the devil's tramping grounds is located near harpers crossroads near bennett. * charlie daniels lived in the goldston area as a child and graduated from goldston high school.  *chatham county is one of the few school systems in the state to not offer a middle school football program. *one of the only cases of a rabid beaver ever attacking a human in the us occurred during a rabies outbreak at jordan lake in the mid 1990's. *a secret government facility termed by locals as the ``big hole`` was operated north of pittsboro till around 1996. it was said the site was a virtual concrete city built several stories into the ground. the facility was actually part of the autovon system operated under government contract by at&t.; the site has reportedly been closed due to the introduction of the defense switched network. *the clock currently in the county courthouse was a recent addition added to the courthouse. it was reportedly in the original plans of the courthouse, but for some reason was left out during its original construction. *even though jordan lake is held mostly in the county's borders, county residents get very little drinking water from the lake. most of the water is currently being sold to cary and areas of eastern wake county. these contracts have forced the county to purchase water from neighboring counties to guarantee sufficient supply in the county water system. *many people moving to the research triangle area choose to live in the county because of lower tax rates compared to neighboring counties. *the geographical center of north carolina is said to be near the gulf community south of goldston. this is debated since it is also said the geographical center of the state is in montgomery county. *frances bavier (aunt bea) of andy griffith show fame lived in siler city and is buried there. *it is rumored that several of the costumes for the movie titanic were actually purchased from antique stores in pittsboro. *the county is one of the largest (in terms of land size) in the state. *since the county is wedged between the piedmont triad and the research triangle many residents in the western portion of the county do most of their commerce in the greensboro area, while those in the eastern portion do most of theirs in the research triangle area. *pittsboro was once considered to house the university of north carolina. *the county was once a leading shipper of wild rabbit meat. around the turn of the century ``chatham rabbit`` was a known delicacy in restaurants as far away as new york. *it is rumored that singer clay aiken recently built a home in an undisclosed development in the county and lives there full time. while this is interesting, we can't use it unless you provide a source. also, none of this is really trivia, as trivia by its definition is ``unimportant information`` - it therefore shouldn't be in a trivia section but instead the information should be incorporated into the main article. -   `

   to nawlinwiki   please can you explain to me and the thousands of people out there who have experienced the same issue, the huge double standards that take place on wikipedia. the post you deleted is no different than a lot of other posts on this site. see  as a reference. it seems to me that every post on this site is at the whim of the ego of the wiki editor in charge at that time. i am not asking for this page to be considered for inclusion if it is not a relevant page but i am asking for some solid standards and that every page be judged equally.

`  ::::i think you are talking second part of the story (after the war, relocation period). ``what gave turks the right to tell armenians what to do?`` i didnt get you. armenian and turks were living together in the same land and were being ruled by ottoman empire, so ofcourse turks had the right to tell armenians what to do. you mean ottoman empire requested different things from armenians as compared to turks? a facist request? what about raping turkish woman they were also woman there were no difference. these kind of things are happening in all war in history and nobody knows if it is true. you mean that turks were facist and hating armenians and raped them? so article is generally about second half of the story. relocation of armenians.    `

`  definitely his views contradict the current principles of wikipedia. i don't think his intention is to comply with them. if no one expresses dissatisfaction and advocates change, there would be no improvement.  on the other hand there are users who are abusing the system covertly, like user zoe and user mikkalai. user zoe is using wikipedia to torture people by artificially finding fault in people's contributions. if she is not sufering from sadistic personality disorder, why doesn't she make contributions herself? what's there in it for her?   user mikkalai's point of view is not neutral. user mikkalai from belarussia (an area notorious for right wing tendencies) who is behind the current edition of the intelligentsia article seems to have a political has reconstructionist, zarist, and nationalistic bias and his edits distort the truth through omission, taking things out of context, and other tools of propoganda. for some reason he stops on pre-revolution russia, as if there was no further developments after that? is that neutral?    the important role intelligentsia played during the soviet epoch (70 years of history) is understated if not absent from the article. there is no explanation of the role jewish intelligents played in the revolution, and why many jewish intelligents joined the revolution (pogroms and cherta osedlosti) is not mentioned. he is quoting lenin as calling intelligents ``the shit of the nation``, while he does not mention that lenin and trotsky were intelligents themselves.   the attribute of a cosmopolitan is not mentioned either, obviously because it is associated with jews.   he listed for deletion about abram kamensky, under the pretext of not being notable enough to be in wikipedia. abram kamensky was mentioned in russian jewish encyclopedia, which is a printed encyclopedia compiled by international experts. how is it that this person is not notable enough to be mentioned in an online encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone?  this person was mentioned in a solzhenitsin's novel, he was a deputy minister of the ministry of national affairs, one of the first people to join the bolshevik party, as mentioned in the debate involved in the founding of the short-lived donetsko-krivorogian soviet republic,  father of a well-known russian art critic. this is enough to make him notable. the reason he was demoted to a lower post was because he was briefly a member of the trostkyst opposition, which stalin didn't forgive him for. at any rate, the argument that he was somewhat obscure by the time of his death does not hold water, because many people who were famous died in obscurity.  the point is, user mikkalai from belorussia does not possess a thorough enough knowledge of soviet history to make that judgement. the reason he listed the article for deletion was personal and political bias.   i thought the purpose of wikipedia was so people could add research and facts to someone's start-up. not to list every start-up that is perhaps not well researched enough for deletion.  user mikkalai even listed aleksander kamensky article for deletion for reason of non-notability  one of the most well known art crtitics in later twentieth century russia, and an internationally recognized expert on marc chagall, whose book marc chagall, the russian years was an international best-seller, and was postthamously reprinted and presented at the tretiakov gallery with marc chagall's granddaughters in attendance. what do you think, this guy knows what he is talking about?  he has vandalized aleksander kamensky article. he took out kamensky's definition of the stern style that was one of the three quotes from one of his books, translated personally by levkamensky for the article. while in the articles discussion page he requested stern style to be defined. this shows that he deleted it without even reading it. if that is not vandalism, than what is? this is a wolf in sheeps clothing. i suggest reverting the article to levkamensky's last edition and blocking it from further editing.  wikipidia articles are always on the first page when you make a search on google, or another search engine. this makes wikipidia a very influential tool in swaying public opinion. many people complain that americans are dumb, and they don’t know basic facts, or that they are shallow. well now with the internet, they are becoming more aware, but don’t leave them in the hands of half-illiterate graduate students, or right wing fanatics.  why was the russian intelligentsia category deleted, that levkamensky created, that contained some three dozen brightest minds in russian culture of the xx century? why does the russian social groups category contain cosacs and peasants but not intellectuals? we think this is more political than neutral.   so stop using wikipedia

  ==edits to characters==  just a note of the corrections i made to the character section:  under full moon, i added that in the final episode, she sings 'love chronicle' which was the third ending theme and the closing song of full moon's last concert.  under fuzuki, it said 'fiancee' which not only lacks the accent, but a double e is the feminine.  for wakaouji, i explained when takuto explained just after when izumi tries to trick mitsuki into jumping, he tells the doctor that he remembers the past and he was route l's singer, and the agreement they made.  under madoka, it doesn't matter if two people audition with the same song. eternal song was planned as madoka's debut single. madoka's plan was that this way full moon wouldn't be able to sing the song at the same time, especially since they originally had the same producer. since mitsuki had her heart set on the song, she and ooshige tried to get another producer. eventually, under certain conditions, wakaouji agrees to the job.  also, in the anime, in one episode showing herself as a young child actress, she is shown to go through a lot before the anime began. full moon, on the other hand, rose to stardom with relatively little effort.

you're an idiot.      >...downvoted just because people don't agree.      yes, that's correct.      why do you think that is? you think you get upvotes because of respect? because you're right?       the voting system is purely democratic. and it changes with the audience. if you put this comment on twitter directly under another person who was upset with beiber, then you'd likely get heaps of likes. unfortunately, they're useless and nobody should really care about them.      >...you have to find every single joke on the planet absolutely hilarious...      who said that? quote me one person in this thread or in the entirety of this comment section who said something along those lines. i seriously want to know.      i don't know anyone who says that. it's basically impossible to find most jokes funny. not everyone can appreciate light humour like piano cat while still enjoying holocaust jokes. but hey, if you can, then you're probably insane.      that being said, if you really hate certain jokes that much, ignore them. anyone who tells speeches or does stand-up knows that the worst feeling you could have after saying something is not a unanimous reaction or a food execution, but just complete silence as everyone transitions to whatever else they were doing.       >i feel like the people who get bent out of shape when someone doesn't agree with them are the ones who are way too sensitive...      yes. again, yes. no one disagrees with you there, especially the aforementioned maniac.      i would go as far as saying most people who get bent out of shape are very sensitive, almost as if that's a defining trait of sensitive people, discounting those that are too shy to voice their opinion, of course.      edit: spelling      tl;dr fuck you read what i said


  ==vote on this== *are you people for real?  comparing reggie jackson to wade boggs?  reggie played 5 great years for the new york yankees, boggs played 2 not so great years with the tampa bay devil rays when he was way past his prime.  the only reason that wade boggs wanted to wear the devil ray hat when he was inducted was that the devil rays offered him money if he agreeded to wear the hat.  if wade wanted to waer a yankees hat, the hall wouldnt have said anything because wade played great for the yanks and won a world series with them.  the point is reggie jackson did great things for both the new york yankees and oakland a's.  we the people should vote for whether the color is of the a's or the yankees.  even though everyone remembers reggie as a yankee and hardly anyone remembers him as an a.  ever wonder why espn and all the sports channels show reggie's yankee highlights and not any a's highlights?  reggie is a yankee 4ever.  whats next, putting la dodger colors on ricky hendersons page?

`  == figures in the infobox... once again ==  i found this:  the russian defeat of berlin was inevitable for they outnumbered the germans in men 5:1, guns 15:1, tanks 5:1 and planes 3:1. < that's a lot more (2x more men, and no german artillery in infobox at all).  until recently the russians had claimed that they lost 10,000 men during the battle for the seelow heights and 100,000 in berlin. the actual figures are unknown. yet no less than 30,000 red army soldiers were killed at seelow, and the staggering figure of 600,000 killed in berlin seems more plausible. konev complained at one point that he was losing 1,000 men a day because zhukov's artillery failed to shift fire when asked. zhukov denied that allegation, stating that konev was not using his troops intelligently. < now a hole damn lot more (wikipedia now claims only 81,000 communist soldiers were killed in the whole operation, while even the old soviet figures were appearently more 100,000 in the city alone).   i'd like to note battle of the seelow heights says 35,000 communist soldiers were killed in this battle, which is even more than claimed by these sources.  other source (modern russian): the battle of berlin was a costly and bloody one with over 300,000 soviet casualties. the number of german losses is unknown but roughly 480,000 were taken prisoner. (infobox says ``134,000 captured``)  still another: however, it should be noted that the soviet union placed their own casualties as over 300,000 in the two weeks of fighting from the oder to the collapse of berlin.8this number included killed, wounded and missing. interestingly, recent western sources place the total casualties suffered by the soviets as even higher. (...) although the exact estimate of russian casualties during the battle for berlin is unclear (infobox says ``81,000 killed``, etc - while everyone knows the soviet numbers were completely unreliable.)  how about just not putting any figures, as are really just unknown?   also, britannica about overall soviet (unknown!) losses:   available estimates of soviet casualties vary widely. a soviet officer  who served with the high command in berlin and left the soviet service in 1949 placed total military losses at 13,600,000 8,500,000 dead or missing in battle; 2,600,000 dead in prison camps; 2,500,000 died of woundsand estimated civilian casualties at 7,000,000. these figures have been widely accepted in germany, but most u.s. compilations, based on soviet  announcements, list 6,000,000 to 7,500,000 battle deaths. calculations made on the basis of population distribution by age and sex in the 1959 u.s.s.r. census give some credence to the higher figures, for they seem to indicate losses of from 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 males of military age in world war ii. the figures used here are a compromise estimate, not intended to obscure the fact that soviet casualties are, in reality, unknown in the west.    `

(he seems to think that wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. nice. [URL] ) anyway, matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when matt's own childish remarks (similar to matt's reply above) are repeated back to matt in an effort to show matt his childishness (and to mock matt) matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  i suppose matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. sadly, matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his ``nah-nee-nah`` voice. it is amusing, though, to see matt (a grown-up?) do it.  here are the points that matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know:    1. dr. rex curry showed that the usa's first pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous national socialist german workers' party (nazis). professor curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient roman salute, and that the ``ancient roman salute`` is a myth. [URL]    2. the pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. historic photographs are at [URL] and at [URL]   due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the nazi salute. the nazi salute is an extended military salute. [URL]  3. francis bellamy (author of the ``pledge of allegiance``) and edward bellamy (author of the novel ``looking backward``) and charles bellamy (author of ``a moment of madness``) were socialists.  edward and charles were brothers, and francis was their cousin. francis and edward were both self-proclaimed national socialists and they supported the ``nationalism`` movement in the usa, the ``nationalist`` magazine, the ``nationalist educational association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and edward inspired the ``nationalist party`` (in the usa) and their dogma influenced socialists in germany, and the pledge was the origin of the nazi salute.  ``nazi`` means ``national socialist german workers' party.`` a mnemonic device is the swastika. although the swastika was an ancient symbol, professor curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by german national socialists to represent ``s`` letters for their ``socialism.``  hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``s`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on volkswagens.  [URL]  dr. curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  german national socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``hakenkreuz.``   professor curry showed that many modern myths rely on a false belief that nazis called themselves ``nazis`` (party members referred to themselves as ``national socialists`` and did not use the term ``nazis``).`


  hello again,  no, im not ashley favel - i know someone who could very well be his younger brother, but he and i are quite separate people. after a quick glance across his page, i can see why you considered us to be the same people )  the society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name. for example, a student whom is now a astronaut with nasa was once a humble member - andy thomas that is. several other events throughout time, such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge, the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south, the stealing and ransom of ronald mcdonald from the myer center - all were orchestrated by aues members. the way i have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow, local, audience, but when thought about, they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population. things such as the hot water system in the crown and anchor pub, in the city, being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable, in my opinion.  ahh, have to run. will continue this later,  cheers

` also you do indeed semantically insinuate that ean's parent's were guilty of abuse by declining her statement ``ean's story`` as a reliable record. i don't think barbara proctor would be very happy with you. also the entire point behind the proctor case is the way it displays the milieu that wessely and colleagues inhabit. a milieu which is simply not acceptable by the majority of the public. taking children away from parent's because of what hyde would call ``a failure of science`` is severely damaging to wessely's reputation in the public mind. please don't quote ``positive signs`` of hysteria gould et al laid that one to rest, common in most severely brain damaged patients.`

`change my perception toward your edit. freaking is so civil language? i don't think so. you erased the valid information regarding the criminal's original name. non-english speakers adapt alphabet spellings from country to country if they translate or transliterate their native language into english. if the kanji are not given on the article, how do readers know which japanese are ``the criminals`` that's why i made the valid revert you edit. besides, what is 'instrumentalized'? i can't understand what you're saying.    ::*``freakin'`` is either used instead of ``very``, or when you are upset about something. it is not a bad word. for example: ``i'm so freakin' tired`` (== ``very``) or ``my girlfriend talks too much on the freakin' telephone`` (==upset). ::*no, i didn't ``erase`` the ``valid`` information regarding the name. i forgot to re-add them after taking out the inappropriate interwikis (see also wikipedia:manual of style (japan-related articles)linking to japanese wikipedia) ::*anyway, so what? you could have just re-added it it yourself. which would have been polite and saved everyone a lot of time.  ::*and, reverts are for vandalism etc (see wp:revert policy), not for reverting edits just because you don't like it. so, not valid.  ::*secondly, i *did* re-add it myself. but you reverted anyway. no excuse because you did not read! so, again, not valid. ::*``instrumentalize`` means to (mis)use something. for example, the way newspapers used a war story for propaganda effect. they ``instrumentalize`` horrors of war to show how ``great`` their soldiers are. do you understand what i mean? ::     :::hmm.. this is so wasting my time to hear your unreasonable complaint. so you keep denying to acknowledge your mistake as erasing the info first. if you had been cautious about how people judge what is valid per edit history, you can't accuse me of reverting it without any reason. that is it. you can re-add your wordings without erasing the critical info.     ::::my ``unreasonable`` complaint? what is my complaint? that you didn't read? that you violated every point in wp:revertdo not twice? ::::no, i am not denying having made the mistake in the first place. i have already said this three times.  ::::but you should have fixed it yourself! improve articles! don't destroy the work of others. and do not assume that other people are being destructive. ::::i should not have to be ``cautious about how people judge what is valid per edit history.``  ::::i should not be assuming that people are poor judges, because that would be bad faith in others. ::::i should be able to *expect* that people will *think* and *read* and work together to make wikipedia a good place and a good resource.  ::::i should not expect bad things. i should not expect editors to revert. reverts are evil! they destroy goodwill. ::::if you have goodwill, then you should now fix the article yourself. or at least say sorry! ::::     == nor request for arbitration ==  because of your participation in discussions relating to the ``psts`` model in the no original research article, i am notifying you that a request for arbitration has been opened here. i invite you to provide a statement encouraging the arbcom to review this matter, so that we can settle it once and for all.    ==nor plea== fullstop, please stop snark-baiting jossi. i've very much appreciated what you had to say in the discussion, but the credibility of your words are diminished with the silliness. i completely understand how frustrating it can be in something like this  and no this isn't my business  but as a relative newcomer to this discussion the snark b/w you & jossi seems really pointless. i don't mean to cause offense and, again, i've thought you made uncommon good sense with your substantive points. so i'd like it if we could maintain the high ground on those ....     :no, you cause no offense at all. ) point noted. but i will continue (though with a more judicious choice of words) to point out any attempts to change the subject. its a symptom of denial, which is in turn a principle cause for the ring-a-roses.

`::dear , ward churchill admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of tv cameras, last night, february 22, 2005, that he is not in fact an indian.  he has been lying about his heritage for many, many years and people like me, who live and work in indian country everyday, have known for years that he was out and out lying about his heritage.  i repeat:  ward churchill during his speech at the university of hawaii admitted that he is not an indian.  the comment, word for word, was published in the honolulu star-bulletin, vol. 10, issue 54wednesday, february 23, 2005 churchill attacks essay’s critics by craig gima.  i'm going to attempt to be gracious but i have to say that you and  missed the boat on this one.  i'm not going to do it tonight because i do need sleep, but there is going to be huge re-write of the article tomorrow because the article is just flat out wrong now.  these ``allegations`` of ``fabrications`` have been provable facts of fabrications.  it calls into questions so many other things about the guy.  what other things is he out and out lying about???  but more importantly the way that the section on his fake indian heritage needs to be completely re-written.  considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in indian country who dared to question his indian heritage claims over the years, i think that indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming.  so many peoplewho do not even live in indian country, who do not work in indian countrymade the claim that to dare question the great ward churchill's fake indian heritage was a ``cheap shot.``  we have been hearing that from non-indians for many, many years and now churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years.  he claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters.  that is a damn lie too.  he has been claiming indian heritage for over 20 years.  it is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books.  he refers to the fake indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article.  he committed fraud when he applied to the university of colorado.  the denver post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is indian for affirmation action purposes.  that is a damned lie.  there is going to be re-write and jodi rave's comments are going back in and all the rest.  your attempts to stifle the topic has ended by churchill himself.-   `

  i'm sorry but that kind of lying is not good for anyone (dyslexics). you know, you know i'm fairly expert on both mediums. not knowing bane is from the 90's and claiming you know the comics, is like claiming you know american politics and think there is only one president named george bush. your lack on the basics tells on you.  besides, there are other ways of personal attacks, aside the insults. saying such lies is one, unnecesary adjetives to describe my prose (which i admit, for the 100th time, is not that good) is other. even what i'm doing right know could be considered as one pa, if you are too strict. the only personal atack, if you will, was when i did the critisism on the incomplete intro, although i wasn't directly talking about you and i didn't call you moron or something like you like to call me on the summaries or public disscusion pages like this one. when i called you cynical, it wasn't an insult either, because you seem shameless to tell such lies as you did just above this words. i do own most of the important batman, dcu, superman, gl, flash and jla titles, series, hc versions, and crossovers from the 80's to now, and then some of the 70's, and even most wisard issues, if you want me to show some creds, but the average guy here owns more. so i do know what i talking about, and you did see me make this pictire, so you are lying. and is not like i enjoy you following me to whatever page i go, talking to whatever people i talk and trying to explain that i'm not the bad guy. what kind of person are you that you dedicate so much time to harass somebody that is talking about topics you don't even care. you said you don't watch the animated show...half your contribs are fron topocs related to them! and only becouse you follow me there, as you can check on those pages history pages. i realy don't understand you.

  == re: sarah brightman peer review ==  thanks for the comments, they're much appreciated.  about the context - believe me, i'd love to find more material for this, but everything i've found seems to focus less on her and more on more recently prominent crossover acts (josh groban, il divo, etc.) i'm working on it though. not sure i should mention amelia since she doesn't have an album out yet and it's going to be released independently. i still need to update for the greatest hits albums; looking for good solid information on that.  


actually there is a huge logic to rastafari but like any complex subject it may appear incomprehensible to thosen who dont understand where the movement is coming from. surely all religion is by nature absurd, if it wasnt it wouldnt be religion and for me this makes rasta a genuine faith. by all means find some sourceable criticism and add it but saying the rasta beliefs are beyond the pale wont wash eg in their belief that life is to be lived here on earth and not in some promised after life rastas have shown themselves to be far more rational than other religions, and in his majesty they have  chosen a man of high moral calibre to be god and king, much better than all those false prophet cult leaders like hubbard, moon, etc,    


if there's one thing i learned, it's that as soon as somebody says "this is a fact", you can in fact assume that it's anything but a fact. facts don't need anybody reiterating that they're facts.


that's about right.


  == memory buffer upgrade == if anyone knows more about it, there should be a discussion of the memory buffer upgrade why for example does doubling the memory result is more than double (from 28 to 68) the number of shots in nef (raw) (12-bit lossless compressed mode fx mode, but no increase at all in small jpgs (it remains at 130). i suspect this is related to the fact that small files can be shited to main memory at a rate close to the maximum frame rate of the camera, but much larger files can't be transfered as quickly. but a more detailed explanation would be useful.    


`  ==in response to your comment== lingeron, i thought we agreed to disagree so that this issue did not escalate :i didn't agree to anything. (i received no response, so thus, it has to be assumed that you agreed) :receiving no response does not deduct to assuming anything. why are you continuing to try and parade my advice around as a threat, :i paraded nothing. i found the threat you made (fallout) a tad disturbing and was discussing it with another editor. thus escalating matters for the entire community? if people oppose because of the support votes, then we will not have any 75 percent majority, thus resulting in no more administrator promotions. now please, i ask you to reconsider this viewpoint in fairness. one oppose vote out of 132 support votes does not constitute 75% of the vote and changes nothing. i said why i opposed. i still say that. i'm sorry if you don't understand it or don't like it. i stand by it. the more coersion i receive the more against this whole thing i get. just come right out and say what you mean by fallout. just say it.  you said something like you were sorry if you sounded frank. you don't. i am the one who is being honest. if you want to harass me and set the admins after me, go ahead. if you want to block me feel free, i certainly can't stop you. i said the same thing to inshanee.  `

  ==wikistalkers by erstwhile administrators deserve severe sanction.  dear bk:  thank you.  however, this has soured me, and i will cure myself of my wikiaholic behavior. i quit. they've achieved their victory, and wiki will lose my modest contributions.  that being said, i think you should look close at what they edited, and come to your own conclusion. they gutted whole articles.  this was wikistalking and they went far beyond what they complained about. this was search and destroy, pure, simple and unvarnished. it was a clear abuse of power. i will not abide an abuse of power, and will not let this rest without their being brought to justice  they are bullies, and this was wrong.  i for one would not stand silently and idly by while the wehrmacht makes the jews disappear into the railroad cars.  moreover, their actions showed an intent (and attempt) to bully me into silence about their misconduct. it was a cover up.  accountability in this system is important. those who abuse their powers do not deserve to be trusted to hold the reins. they deserve the severest sanctions, and should be stripped of administrative privileges.  what they did here was very destructive of the goals of an organization that depends on the good will and volunteer efforts of contributors.  7&6=thirteen (talk) stan


`  ::the original arab text refers to a jihad against zionists and crusaders. most of the people of the world have a big problem with zionists and crusaders, including me (a christian), and most of my jewish friends. up until 9/11, we assumed that our leaders (of the united states) followed a higher law than ``might makes right.`` when the tragedy happened, we thought that the law and civility the ``free world`` had established would prove to these ``backward people`` that there are superior methods of dealing with disputes than to hurt and kill each other.  ::instead, our united states representatives proved bin laden right. they fell into every trap that he ``prophesied.`` bin laden was able to drain us of over two trillion dollars, expose the atrocities that we had previously been able to hide from most of the world (including our own people), and draw us into a war that we cannot win. there may not have been very many people actively fighting against the bigotry of zionists and crusaders a few years ago, but the united states response to 9/11 has certainly opened our eyes since then. i can assure you that large numbers of people from all ethnic and religious groups consider themselves part of the front against the war crimes being committed.  `

  == is it a genuine user ==  a user 59.180.173.138 (details given below) has deleted my contributions and has pretended to be an admin (probably) but his user page is blank.  i went to his user/talk page and saw the wikipedia message about the user page not existing and no messages either being posted for the said user.  what i saw on that talk page is copied below:  support wikipedia: a non-profit project. — donate now editing user:59.180.173.138 from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia wikipedia does not have a user page with this exact title. in general, this page should be created and edited by user:59.180.173.138.  nonetheless, it is good to see such fictitious people emerging and these new 'entities' are probably one among the scores of sock-puppets being used for manipulation on wikipedia.    it is of course pointed out that i have not made any personal attacks but pointed out not just glaring contradictions and discrepancies but also but steadfast refusal of such 'contributors' to realize these points and make corrective action.  i have posted in detail above about my contributions on the chola dynasty and explanations and justifications for such postings along with not just the sources but also the quality of such sources and information.  i am indeed waiting for detailed discussions in case required. unless that is done, any deletion of my contributions without assigning reasons is also as improper, as per established wikipedia norms, as posting or making additions to an article without giving sources and references.  i am sure a neutral admin like taprobanus and other contributors from the tamil nadu group will certainly reason in my trying to better the quality of the article on chola dynasty.    through the medium of this post, i also request the admins to initiate a debate on the origins of the so-called 'chalukya chola dynasty' which according to me never existed... (all the inscriptions right from kulothunga i to the last chola king rajendra iii) bear evidence to the fact that these kings either directly or indirectly, never addressed themselves as chola chalukya or chalukya chola.  it is again the handiwork of manipulators who seek to maintain and continue the title chalukya chola.  by the same token kings after vikramaditya vi in the chalukya page should be called chola chalukya because that king was a son in law of virarajendra chola.. and hoysalas after veera ballala ii starting with his son veera narasimha should be called hoysala chola or chola hoysala because ballala ii was a son in law of chola king kulothunga iii.  thanks.

`   you seem to have a problem when confronted on your somewhat radical views around nitrites and poppers.  you are mistaken in many respects, including who ``mr. allabout is. -)   suggest you stop your childish behavior, and instead confine your posts to trying to dissemenate more accurate information, or at the very least, allow others who have the knowledge you lack, to do  so. you would better serve the general public by not trying to harrass and deny access to people who actually have accurate knowledge on the subject of nitrites and poppers and, instead, let them have a fair opportunity to set the record straight. vandalizing their posts, or using wiki-expertise and tricks to deny them access, have them blocked, banned, etc, is simply unfair, and innapropriate behavior.  `

`  == musings ==  hey friday  while blocked the past two days i read through your subpages.   things like /admin etc.  they are great!  i'm burning out on this project  editing can be a lot of fun but in the recent past i've received so many hassles from editors following me around and admins interpreting policies liberally in order to block me.   i also saw that i'm not the only one who's been on the receiving end of this.   i've seen it all but its too long to go into here.  i'm not sure if these are new trends or just something i haven't spent the time to look into before.    ``mere editors`` really have little recourse in this.   filing arbitration proved exhausting for me in the past.   it required a huge amount of diff hunting and discussion for what seemed to me was a pretty obvious case of an out-of-line editor.   filing against an admin would, i assume, be much, much worse.   admins seem to behave like inner-city police with their wall of silence.  a lot of your comments show that you've noticed the same happenings.  in an ideal world i think you are right  people would behave reasonably...but i am pessimistic that will happen.   i have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to firm up wikis policies.   we need to define what something like ``disruption`` is.   when someone is blocked for a personal attack, the diff should be included.   that a requirement for including evidence is controversial is evidence that it time for change; we've tried the ``trust admins to do what is right``.   it has failed.   `

`  ==too many lies in this para=== in following para, yogindar sikand is a muslim convert and his name is mentioned as hindu representative. the first statement is a lie as he is not a hindu representative.  representatives of hinduism held a variety of views on muhammad, some with an assertion that the prophet was none else than the narashansrishi of the vedas, predicted in the atharva veda.[183] one of the prominent vaishnava proponents, a.c. bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada maintained that mohammad and jesus, were empowered representatives of god, saktiavesa avataras.[184] in a variety of other points of view, some translated the phrase ``the last prophet``, suggesting that vedic deity agni is none other but muhammad.[185] in 1926 siddiq hussain's two-volume kannada book, ja at guru sarwar-i 'alam, argued that the muhammad was actually kalki avatar whose arrival had been predicted in the hindu scriptures, however this view is not a widely accepted doctrine.[186] on the other hand mirza ghulani ahmad argued that rama and krishna were prophets of god who had foretold the arrival of muhammad as god's last law-bearing prophet.[187] mohammad is sometimes linked to the passage of the rig veda declaring that narashams rishi will arrive as the ``last divine messenger`` (antim deva duta), who shall ``dispel all darkness`` and ``conquer death``.[188]`

  :: hello nydas, which parts they don't agree with? as in some view themselves as distinct from other scots? the ethnogenesis of scots isn't any less complicated than that of other peoples, it just happens to be a more recent one. as for the north american argument, it's the same thing with any other people. italians in the us and canada generally do not discrimante within their communities but back in the old country some people do care about lombard or norman heritage for example. that doesn't mean italians don't exist.

` :it's because of the pan-canadianist pretense that because bc is a province of canada, it should have a bilingual name (why this is done for the latin ``nova scotia`` into french, when we don't say ``new scotland`` in english, is another matter); i agree with you and i think once-upon-a-time removed the french, but i guess it's back.  there's a certain lexical irony/injustice in the french translation, too, because the ``columbia`` part of the name comes from the river (via the fur district named after it), not the country (i.e. columbia as the poetic name for the us, with nothing to do with colombia except the shared namesake); the river got its name not from the poetic name of the us, but from capt. gray's ship the columbia, which was the first to enter and sail up the river (so 'tis claimed); and the ship was named for the us, by way of its poetic name.  confusing, huh?  yeah, but the upshot is that in french the name of the river is la fleuve columbia, but they insist that bc's name in french should be la colombie-brittanique i.e. from la colombie, which is the name for the south american country.  this is not just bad history of course, it's downright incorrect; the columbia portion of the we are expected to use accents on montreal and quebec when writing english; they can't even be bothered to get our name, and its history, right.  ``they`` includes me, by the way, as i'm 1/4 franco-canadien and, for someone born in bc, speak it pretty well (from my own initiative, not from family background).  anyway, in a historical/lexical sense the french name should be la colombia-britannique``; the clincher would be in any historical french-language hbc or nwc documents referring to the columbia fur district in french, i.e. as to which form they used; not that anybody in l'office de la langue francaise or the academie francaise'' gives a ****.  my two bits, and what-for. `

`, i concur with white guard that lenin and his government committed many atrocities against the russian people, and your attempt to 'whitewash' their reputation is somewhat historically inaccurate (please don't take this as a personal attack). as for the kulaks, you're perfectly correct that they never really existed as a class, and were invented by the communists as an attempt to encourage 'class warfare' in the countryside - yet you choose to ignore the fact that it was lenin, not stalin, who began the campaign against the kulaks. it was, admittedly, stalin who was responsible for the wholesale purging of kulaks as part of his collectivisation programme. overall, i would say stalin took lenin's ideology to new heights of paranoia and mass murder - but the foundations of this ideology were all in the system that lenin established. stalin was worse than lenin, but there wasn't a clean historical break between the two - they were part of the same authoritarian and brutal communist tradition.    == what is to be done?-part iii ==  further remarks are obviously required.   anti-semitism.  could i please have a reference for nicholas' authorisation of the kishinev massacre?  as far as i am aware this episode was the handiwork of vyacheslav plehve, minister of the interior and a notorious anti-semite.  the pogrom was condemned by the governor of bessarabia and by the central government.  sergius witte, by far the tsar's best minister, made his own feelings on the matter plain.    there were pogroms in tsarist russia, and anti-semitism was a long-established and poisonous tradition.  the point is that this cannot always be traced back to the tsar: russian state and government was far too complex for that.  official anti-semitism was, moreover, of a confessional rather than a biological nature.  under alexander iii the drive for assimiliation became ever greater, after the murder of his liberal-minded father, but it also affected catholics, lutherans and muslims, as well as jews.  civil disabilities could always be lifted for converts to orthodoxy, for those who were minded to take this path.    nicholas was a conventional and unimaginitive man, but even he could detect the patently false. although he was initially taken in by the protocols of the elders of zion (as was the london times in 1919) he soon recognised them, according to vladimir burtsev, no friend of the tsar, as dangerous political nonsense.  you may care to consult solomon grayzel, again no admirer of tsarist russia, who in his a history of the jews says ``even the tsar had considered the forgery utterly improbable and unworthy of consideration.`` (philadelphia, 1968, p. 613).    now, this whole debate arose because i questioned lenin's credentials as a campaigner against anti-semitism on the basis of a single speech with no examples provided.  if we look at the actual record of soviet russia under lenin a quite different picture emerges.  the age-old antisemitism of the tsars showed little sign of going away; if anything, it got worse.  red army units were amongst those responsible for pogroms in the ukraine, to the obvious disquiet of trotsky.  during the 1921 campaign against religion, specifically authorised by lenin, the jews were singled out as a special target; even maxim gorky accused the government of using anti-semitism for political purposes.  there were pogroms in smolensk and other places.  when jewish people tried to defend their synagogues, threatened with confiscation, troops broke in, shouting 'death to the yids' in the process.  the campaign of 1921 peaked in the mock trial of 'judaism', carried out, for additionl emphasis, if any such was needed, in the very same courtroom as the beiliss trial of 1913.  what price lenin's support for the jews?  terror.  yes, there was terror, extensive and brutal; but that of the whites was more than matched by that of the reds, and not just against counter-revolutionaries but peope who had been their allies and comrades in the political underground.  by 1921, well after the white threat had gone away, oppression and terror had become a fact of life in the 'worker's fatherland'.  it never went away.   let me make it plain that i am simpy asking that this article reflects the true facts of lenin's career.  as it stands at present it is little more than a biased 'appreciation.'    : i see you've been doing your homework 'white guard'...we are evidentally getting a more intellectual class of red-baiter these days...i therefore pledge myself - on behalf of the 'guardians of the lenin-shrine', at whatever expense in time and money, - to read the chapter 'the pogroms and white ideology in the russian civil war' by p. kenez in

best /tv/ thread in a while tbh


unsarcastically: the idea of "pride" for oppressed or disadvantaged groups is a celebration of overcoming the oppression and disadvantage. it's a collective pride in having made it this far while putting up with all the shit. it's not the only requirement in order to be proud of yourself or celebrate collective accomplishment, but it can definitely be a legitimate source of pride.      there's not much pride in distinctions of no consequence or ones that are advantages unearned, because there was no hurdle to clear, nothing really achieved. that's why "straight pride" sounds silly or obnoxious, depending on the baggage. this isn't to say "straight shame" is legitimate either, just "straight... is an adjective which applies" is more the right speed.

`== merge proposal ==  i would support a merge, but the current suggestion has mergefrom ``grosser . . . `` mergeto ``großer . . .``. perhaps this should be the other way round. although possibly disputed, wikipedia:naming conventions (standard letters with diacritics) appear to recommend not using ``ß``:  :``for special-case characters such as þ, ð and ß, because of the limited geographic regions in which these letters are used, english-speakers in other parts of the world (especially those for whom english is a second language) often find these symbols incomprehensible and unpronounceable. difficulties also arise in terms of how to alphabetize them, since most english speakers, even those for whom english is their native language, do not know where to place them in a standard alphabet. as a result, this guideline recommends that their use be avoided in article titles.`` i presume the swiss would also use the ``ss`` spelling.  `

`  ==patrick walsh on the role of ``extreme rightwing`` agent-provocateurs== as documented by the former royal canadian mounted police undercover agent, mr. patrick walsh, in a recently published book in canada, ``the unholy alliance``, zionists have played a major role in promoting ``nazi`` and other allegedly anti-jewish movement. the much publicised ``nazi`` leader lincoln rockwell was a creature of the zionist terror machine, and played a major role in persuading rich american jews that they should contribute to the zionists, who would protect them from threatened ``anti-semitism``. patrick walsh thoroughly exposes the role of the agent provocateur. the walsh exposures have, according to canadian reports, thrown the zionists and their dupes into some confusion.   patrick walsh would have been most interested to hear andrew campbell's strong objection to a recent reference to ``zionist thuggery``. he was the victim of this thuggery when brutally attacked by a group of jewish defence league members outside a room in the royal york hotel, toronto, who were attempting to break up a school being conducted by eric butler. zionist thuggery has been used against lawful patriotic groups right around the world. the league of rights has constantly warned against extending encouragement to any type of violence, stressing that evil policies can be defeated through the british system of constitutional government.   `

the only way you're going to get most people to contribute to the wellbeing of some toothless, obese, wife-beating, pill-popping fuck in appalachia is to take it from us by force. there's no way to "live as a collective" with someone hundreds of miles away who you've never met and would find objectively revolting if you did. collectivism is a meme that requires local proximity, cultural similarity, and a disproportionate amount of small-scale bullshit politics. if you don't currently have or want to have any of those, it's not remotely feasible. "muh corporashuns" are trying to sell you some sort of constructed ideal to embody, but that doesn't mean you can just assert group identity to 300m+ people and expect them to all love and support one another out of the goodness of their hearts.

yeah i think you're right. i asked parkranger about banning and she said something really vague about some people being banned for shady reasons during all the turmoil, and that she was willing to revisit those bans yet she wouldn't confirm who was doing the questionable banning. i don't know if it was her, trailangel, or some other mod. but she did reinstate some people who had been banned. who knows! i think at this point if the mods don't reign in the people who started the drama (who trailangel called the old guard) things will continue to spiral. but i think the old guard folks have too much power and influence with the mods so there is unlikely to be any action taken against the people who are stirring up the drama & so the drama will continue.

`  dear df67,  thanks for getting back to me so quickly. i promise to become less ``cute,`` and write with greater focus and brevity... next time.  one of the issues that i am sure is being addressed somewhere is that the people who should be editing the neversink gorge page and developing the forestburgh page are so old that they can hardly deal with email. when i begged several of these people (who hate each other) who have vital collections of one of a kind books, documents, photos, articles, etc to look at what i had written and to edit it, they ``saw/experienced`` a ``googleesque`` one way portal; then, the one man who had the courage to click edit looked, blinked, read, stopped, called me and said, ``you claim it's so easy a dog could do it. if it's so easy then have remsen edit it.`` he hung up.  this is not an ``issue`` that can be fixed anytime soon; however, remsen will keep working on it.  as for my ``serious`` issue, i just got a nice note from wesley northrop resolving it:  dear mr bertine, hm, i could have sworn i'd answered you the other day. if this is a duplicate message, please ignore it. as far as i can tell, the account ``petebertine`` has not been banned at all; the block log is totally empty. perhaps you have been misspelling your password? if you have included your e-mail address in your account, you can have a password reminder sent to you. if not, well... i suppose you could start a fresh account (``petebertine2`` or something, for instance). yours sincerely, wesley northrop  pete bertine and remsen are impressed and thrilled with this experience, gold stars to everyone. we are now more determined than ever to get an 89 year old curmudgeon to contribute to wikipedia.  my question: can you please direct me to the best, most successful example on wikipedia of a town, like forestburgh, representing itself in the ``wiki-community;`` and could you provide at least 2 ``wiki-person-users`` that i should attempt to emulate in my quest to create a ``wiki-forestburgh`` full of ``wiki-correct`` content.  sincerely,  pete bertine    `

`  ==sknaht==  sorry about being so backward in my thanks, but i only just discovered your  get-well wishes, which made me laugh — or at least made me try to laugh. ;)  i seem to have misplaced my lungs, although i'm sure they'll turn up somewhere; i've resorted to buccal breathing, in respectful and appreciative solidarity with our amphibian friends ;)  one thing occurred to me in my languid repose: we should discuss the age dependence of the immune system.  you know, how young toddlers seem to have super-charged immune systems (important for surviving day-care) whereas older people get sick more readily?  one cute factoid i gleaned from a dentist was that older people get a lot more cavities because they have dry mouths; producing less saliva means fewer protective peptides and they suck on sweet lozenges to wet their whistles, providing a nice diet of pure sucrose for their unwelcome guests.  anyway, speaking more generally, i think that lay readers would be really interested in the whole age-dependence thing, as it touches all their lives.  maybe someone there can look into it?  i'll try to tackle the hormonal thing.  slinking back to bed,   p.s. for someone with ``very poor memory``, you're remarkably good at remembering our mcb votes. ;) (note to self: recalibrate scale for tim's self-assessments.)  thanks muchly for your own vote of confidence, and i'll be happy to relieve you of the more mundane tasks, once i get well again.  hopefully,  will recover before i do!`

  :i look forward to reading your re-write. oh yes that quote is from the film sneakers.  


`i understand that a long thread like this can make you confused but, as mentioned before, the traditions were mentioned in passing as a reference to common swedish culture today (one of the ethnicity criteria). the fact that they perhaps build on earlier pagan traditions, very likely common within the whole germanic area, is merely interesting.  as for my source, i would still say that self identification based on research is much more legitimate than anything you can come up with. quoting one sentence from the finnish ministry for foreign affairs webbpage, based on some junior civil servants (webb-editors?) personal opinion, is not more legitimate than creative interpretation of a swedish medical study (which actually does'nt support your claim).    selective quoting out of context in fact seems to be your speciality, regardless of the source. besides the portion of text you quote regarding a small area of swedish finland, you did notice the bold text that forms the summary of the text? ``det svenska området omfattar nyland, åboland, åland och österbotten. området är i stora drag oförändrat sedan 1100- och 1200-talet, då högmedeltidens stora bebyggelsevåg förde svenska nybyggare till de obebodda kusttrakterna i finland`` (the swedish area incompasses nyland, åboland, åland och österbotten. the area is generally unchanged since the great middle-age migration that carried swedish settlers to the uninhabited coastal areas of finland).  as for the paragraph on movemement that you quote a part of, it concludes with: ``flyttning över den (språkgränsen) har förekommit i alla tider, men har blivit en företeelse i stor skala först i vår tid`` (movement over the language-border has taken place in all times, but has become a large scale phonomenon only in our time).  your comparison to ireland is interesting and in your mind perhaps even relevant. the irish situation is however different, e.g. the english occupation actively surpressed the irish language, culture and heritage. something similar did not take place in finland. in fact the finnish language was actively developed and promoted by finland swedes (initially due to academic interest and in the 19th century as a bulwark against russification).

  seeing as you find it imperative to continue this discussion, i will continue it on the talk page. however, here, discussion about indo-european language family, genetics of armenians, and mixing up ashkenazi jews with mizrahis (jews from the middle east are mizrahi, not ashkenazi!), are off topic.  with regards to the cat.   so, as for the page...:  1) there is a dispute between the turks and the non-turks over what the van cat is supposed to look like. turks prefer solid white coats, kurds and armenians prefer the traditional white cat with red or brown markings in certain areas, etc, and refer to ethnic traditions (in the case of kurds) of legends revolving around these markings.  2) should we make a reference to above mentioned legends, or should we only discuss those on the turkish van page  and 3) merge or not merge  please give me your opinions on these three decisions.  and ps, don't call me mr. it feels funny.

`archive page 1  == 747 table ==  hi how are you? on the table i created at boeing 747, i intentionaly left the first 2 years before deliveries at zero to give a clear picture of when the fisrt plane was delivered to a customer. had i started with 1969, it might make it seem like some deliveries might have been missed. but i started with 1967 and 1968 at zero to show a marked begining of 747s in service. if you dont mind i like to put it back to zero.   * i'm good.  sure, change that back.  that makes sense.  it looked like maybe the deliveries started 2 years behind schedule. -  * went ahead and changed the 1967 number back to 0. -   == 777-300er ==  thanks!   people always make this range mistake. another guy asked me why a 777f has more fuel than 777-200er yet has 5,000 km less range? it took a while for him to get it. * sure.  if you can improve the wording there more, please do so. -   == 787 ==  how is it going? on boeing 787 there are 8 different aircrafts in the specs. i believe we should remove all of them. have a nice 3 table specification chart on the 787-3 787-8 787-9 and thats it. we can even bring the 3-way cross section of the 787 right next to this spec chart. i believe articles need to be stand alone and comparing it to everything diminishes this. why not add ilyushin il-96 here too then? or many other aircaft. the 787 article is very very poorly done. its not an encyclopedic entry. its simply a collection of newsbits. it has become a forum to bash the a350 or even the a380. as soon as a story comes out, somebody writes a paragraph there. i have been doing some updates and i want to know if you agree about making the article more about the 787 and less about other planes.   * hey, going ok here.  i can see both sides on the comparison chart.  2 planes (one smaller and one larger) for comparson is enough.  it'd be ok to remove non-787 planes since other airliner articles don't have them.  the fact this is a new plane helps causes lower quality in the article, i think.  people spend more time just adding info than cleaning it up and all.  i'll keep an eye on it and do what i can.  take it easy bangabalunga.  -   == 747-8 speed ==  you are correct! it was .85 and .845 on boeing last week. i dont know when they changed it. i know that wind tunnel testing has not gone well and the 747-8 will have more drag than 747-400 but i guess in order to have bragging rights against the a380, they must be faster. i am sure airlines will still cruise at 0.845 though in the intercontinental just to be efficient. take care   * no problem.  the 747 has had a cruise speed of mach 0.85 for some time.  don't think there's not that much a difference there.  good catch on the upper deck 3/10 windows thing.  i was confused before.  -   ==hughes helicopters== some user slapped a {notability} tag on the hughes helicopters article. i removed it (to get his attention, as some people don't read the talk pages), and posted comments on the talk page also. i don't know what his problem with the page is, but it might be that it's unsourced. he just put the unreferenced tag up today, so it's not like noone won't know that's a problem. can you take a look, and see what you think? thanks. -   * sure.  will do.  -   ==inlet geometry== on f/a-18 hornet, you added the f-16 as having variable inlet geometry. i always understood that it was fixed on the f-16, and i can have several printed sources on that. has that been changed on later f-16s? -   * i only reverted a change where the f-4 replaced the f-16 in this sentence: the engine air intake of the hornet is notable among its contemporaries for being ``fixed``, unlike the f-14, f-15, and f-16 which have variable geometry or variable ramp engine air intakes..  the f-4 is from an earlier era.  please correct that if needed.  thanks. -   ok. i didn't check the earlier history. i just wanted to ask first to find out why it there in case you had a reason, and now i know. i'll take it out. thanks. - [[use

`the term ``freeskiing`` has been abandoned by the snow sports community that is being explained here. it has since been split into two disciplines, new school skiing and backcountry skiing or big mountain skiing. the term ``freeskiing`` is now used exclusivley by the fis to describe its aerials, moguls, and offpiste skiing. the main difference is the rules. the fis has a governing body which limits the number of spins and flips in aerials and mogul comps, while new school has no governing body or rules regarding what tricks can/cannot be attempted. `


`  == postwar damage ==  the article currently states,  :in 1956, the lower part of the painting was severely damaged when someone doused it with acid. on december 30 of that same year, ugo ungaza villegas, a young bolivian, damaged the painting by throwing a rock at it.  can anyone perhaps elaborate on this? i mean, the dousing of the painting with acid is reported as though this is a normal thing to be done to a masterpiece and so nothing further needs to be said about it. did someone just stroll into the louvre with a beaker of acid and throw it onto the painting? i'd be interested to know the circumstances of this event, in particular why this was done and how it was allowed to happen. who did it? what was the motivation? how was it repaired? etc. etc. | `

`   :: first victim of what? biri's death is not part of the al-aqsa intifada because the intifada started after his death - after ariel sharon's visit to the al-aqsa site. you see, that's how it got the name ``al-aqsa``. the israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the palestinians started the al-aqsa intifada before sharon even visited the al-aqsa site. even the ``palestine facts`` source you cite and the objective mitchell report point to sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-aqsa intifada. of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. we can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. it does no service to wikipedia to throw israeli government propaganda into the article. ( i am sure that won't stop you though).     ::*``also on september 28, 2000, ariel sharon visited the temple mount in jerusalem. this visit became the pretext for instigating large scale demonstrations, the start of the al-aqsa infifada.``    ::*``on september 28, 2000, ariel sharon marched defiantly and provocatively through the al aqsa mosque in jerusalem, touching off the current round of violence. ``     ::the mitchell report: ::*``mr. sharon made the visit on september 28 accompanied by over 1,000 israeli police officers. although israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. on the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed palestinian demonstrators and a large israeli police contingent confronted each other. according to the u.s. department of state, ``palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the western wall. police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.``[4] according to the goi, 14 israeli policemen were injured.[5] similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] thus began what has become known as the ``al-aqsa intifada`` (al-aqsa being a mosque at the haram al-sharif/temple mount). ``    ::furthermore, in the article terrorism_against_israel_in_2000august, it says biri died in august after being attacked by ``terrorists``. (if biri was an israeli soldier in occupied gaza, why are his attackers called ``terrorists`` in wikipedia?). you need to sort out your israeli propaganda to at least get the dates and descriptors right.  ::``* august 27: terrorists attack a group of vehicles traveling to netzarim with two roadside bombs and automatic gunfire.  david biri, age 19, is wounded. ::* august 28: david biri dies of wounds suffered in a palestinian terrorist attack the previous day. ::* september 29: border policeman chief inspector yossi tabaji, 27, of ramle, killed and a second israeli border policeman wounded by a palestinian authority policeman on a joint patrol near kalkiliya district coordinating office. `` ::yossi tabaji and several unnamed palestinian youth were also killed in the days before the ``official start`` of the al-aqsa intifada because there are constant killings almost every day in the conflict. the al-aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after sharon's visit to the al-aqsa site. that is the commonly understood definition of al-aqsa intifada. adding stories about israeli deaths that happened the day before is just israeli government propaganda to deflect blame away from ariel sharon.  `

 march 2009 (utc)  it improves the article because it shows that keith has fraudulently presented himself as something other than what he is.  it goes right to his character. asking how it 'improves' the article is like asking how including revelations that clifford irving made up the hughes bio 'improves' that article.  the real takeway? user blaxthos will do anything to help cover for liberals. and he is a prolific editor at wikpiedia. ultimately this inclusion will stay because it's both newsworthy and speaks to  olbermann's dishonestly.   but this attempt at liberal damage control is far more incriminating of wikipedia in general and user blaxthos in specific.   10:37, 31

` welcome to wikipedia!  i'm glad you want to get involved, but i'm afraid there's a problem with the article you created,   stanley quatavis mitchell.  it did not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in wikipedia.   don't feel too badly; lots of people have a little trouble when creating their first article.  you might find it useful to read your first article for some good advice about starting to create articles on wikipedia.  two important rules of thumb are: avoid  writing about yourself, your business, your family and friends, or your web page, and avoid writing about anything that hasn't been written about in reliable sources like books, newspapers, and magazines.  anyway, don't be discouraged.  i've deleted the article you created, and feel free to ask me if you have any more questions.  if i've made a mistake, and this article really is about a subject that meets the notability criteria, then please let me know my leaving me  and links to at least three newspaper articles, magazine articles, or books that have been written about the subject, and i'll be glad to undelete it, and even add the sources so no other patroller makes the same mistake.  -  ·  `

  it appears that you're right. i put too much faith (any at all) into the poster who put up that text in the first place. we should estimate the temperature shift required to produce our energy:    the electricity economy is, by those old estimates: 1.69521e12,  the temperature of the solar radiation is:   the area of earth is: 510,065,284.702   the cross-sectional area that earth presents to the sun is:   hence the (self-consistent) estimate of the earth's effective temperature is (ignoring electricity):   .  subbing the electricity demand in    net difference:    there is clearly more than enough thermal radiation to satisfy our needs. we should remove that section.

`  i did not set that the proportion justifies any killing. i am just interested in accentuate that for the whole ww ii and every result of the hell in first palace responsible is nazi germany. there was no organized killing like concentrations lagers for civilians with purpose to murder etc at the time of expulsion. also there would not be mob revenges and criminal activity out of government control. to clarify, even 3 years after war the government and country organization was very limited. many people were demoralized by war and easily ready to revenge. when you take for consideration that every one of fifth polish citizen was killed you can imagine how many people can be at end of his tether. now i hear some impersonal blames without actual proofs. uncertainly numbers of deaths and uncertain reasons of those. feely it is juggle with numbers and accusations.  with accusation you must be very specific. i understand and accepted the consideration about what happen, but be specific. be very specific, and do not forget that ``first thing must be put first``. the story is regarding nations rather then individuals. in this case you judge polish people etc. versus german people. one can picture a hell for innocents and compare it with crime against humanity. however imagine how can feel an individual in proportional situation. he was attacked, bitten almost killed. he lost his eye and arm. and now his neighbor says: the other guy lost his finger and got serious blow into his nose so you are equal.  the guy says, but i was attacked and i lost his arm and my eye. never mine the neighbor says: this is a crime to hit somebody. _  i know that it is somewhat strange to compare nation to individuals, but for member of nation which lost so much is no acceptable to say about subject ``b`` arrogantly forgetting about the subject ``a``. simplifying you can not separate result from cause. this why i protest. intentional or not the action can be considered as magnification a part of object which is indivisible. as> `

a real suicidal person wouldn't tell anyone. they'd just do it.      yeah but i'm a wimp and probably wouldn't follow through but i'm still having these unending thoughts every day and it's hard and i want your support.      i made the mistake of telling them this when they were yelling at me about wasting my time and being lazy and getting bad grades and i'm not shitting you my dad told me "well if you're gonna be lazy and just waste space in the world you might as well do it." i'm not even doing that poorly. i have all a's and a b. and the b is in fucking physics for pre med college students, it's hard.       and they actually asked me *why* i'm suicidal. i just fucking am i can't help it it's been like this for 5 years but it's been a lot worse recently. then my dad fucking turns to my mom and asks her why she was suicidal in high school and she says "because my parents didn't love me or care about me and put me in dangerous situations, and i didn't tell anyone i just attempted but failed," and then turns back to me and says "what's your excuse? do you really think we don't love you or something?" like i'm sorry i'm losing the my life is hard competition but i can't just stop feeling like this. and then he finishes up with "you won't actually do it. you're too selfish." honestly fuck my life at this point.       i started crying and told them i just want some support right now and my dad said "you really think we don't give you fucking support" and went on some tangent about how hard his life is because of me and how much he does to support me like no i'm talking about right now this topic i just want you to tell me it's gonna be okay.      all of this was after a like glorious  2 month period of my parents being really nice to me then they hit me with all this shit.      i'm so hurt and starting to think i can't be around them anymore. they're behavior just changes so fucking drastically like this and i don't think i can live with them any longer. i was planning on living at home my freshman year of college (next year) to save money since they offered and we live close to the campus i'm gonna go to but now they're saying they're not sure if they wanna help me anymore and i was told "have fun trying to cover your dorm expenses with your financial aid because we're not gonna help you pay for it." like they're testing if i'll actually leave. i'm fucking confused and trapped. shit fucking sucks man i'm really hurt.       it's not a good day.

  well the americans ignored the un and went to war with iraq.  the war is still illegal whether britain and the states want to admit it or not.  so when the states say you can call yourself whatever you want - it does not mean much - just the americans rewardin a small nation for supporting an illegal war with an illegal name.  i am no greek lover, but this site has made a big dicision to back this small slav state over the un and eu.  so let me get this straight, if iran tomorrow renames itself 'death to all americans' and most the inhabitants back this name as does lets say another few countries...even if the un do not recognise it - this site will??? that is hilarious, stop this insanity and give the page the title fyrom, the legal name.  if tomorrow the un and eu says they recognise the name republic of macedonia, whether it offends all of greece tough - that should be the name.  but as it stands that has not happened, so why pick sides? the agreed name is fyrom for a reason, if everyone thought greece did not have a point they would be laughed out of the negotiations, however that is not the case, the un and eu does not recognise the name macedonia for a reason, this page does not recognise the un, cool for america - for the rest of us, an insult to our intelligence.

townsville isn't exactly tourist central, being shunned away by many tourists in favour for cairns, but however, being the prominent business and government centre for north queensland, townsville has and always will have a population larger than cairns, this coming from a resident who has lived in townsville for his entire life   


the problem is that there's no real way to argue that x is not a reference to y other than just saying it's  unlikely. once someone believes that something is a reference or has a deeper meaning, it's really hard to prove them wrong, even if they don't have any evidence or compelling reason. i'd like to think the burden of proof is on the people trying to prove a connection, but from my experience, it's almost always my burden to try to disprove even the flimsiest connections. "it's a coincidence" isn't really a position that has supporting evidence though.

`  == rindge article ==  hi dh,  thanks for getting in touch about the population figure in the rindge, new hampshire article.  i did hesitate about restoring the info, because every edit you've done has been thoughtful and informative.  as i alluded to in the edit history, basically if you see a town in new hampshire with a 2005 population estimate figure, it's because somebody first put in a figure and called it ``2005 census``.  since there is no such thing, i consult the state office of energy and planning web page, which conducts yearly population estimates, and retrieve the published figure for that town. (concord and peterborough are a few other places where i've had to do that.)  i can see the point of wanting to stick with just the decennial census figures, but i also see that there is a lot of pressure out there among readers to come up with more recent population figures  it may be boosterism, but it also may be caused by people concerned at how rapidly their community is growing.  anyway, i've enjoyed watching your edits go in, and i look forward to seeing more!   `

4. lancaster, pa, september 1777, for only one day? :5. york, pa, september 1777, to use susquehanna river as defense against british :6. princeton, nj :7. annapolis, md :8. trenton, nj :9. new york, ny :10. philadelphia :11. washington, d.c.  i think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the united states.  of these, new york city and philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  one question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  do we start the clock at the signing of the declaration of independence, the article of confederation, or the constitution.  i think that the constitution would be the key event because before that, america was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.  also, i believe that new york city did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  i think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making philly the permanent capital.  in my opinion, philly should be considered the first capital of the u.s. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the constitution.  the fact that philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.  however, i am not a historian or an expert in early american history, so i don't want to update the article myself.  also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.  daniel barbalace : see [URL] for email address.

 :the sentence you quote only asserts that an equation that is part of a scientific theory yields a certain numerical result if appropriate numbers are supplied for the mass of the sun and the mass of the earth, etc. the calculated numerical value is significant because, for one thing, 200 watts of energy is the equivalent of one of the larger incandescent light bulbs used in homes. they are easy to see from a few hundred meters away, but from even someplace as close as the moon it would be a very faint signal. a gravitational wave that would cross space from the vicinity of another star, diminished by the r squared rule, and still be powerful enough to agitate our crude instruments would have to be a very major event.

 2008 (utc)  :::as for the question, if races exist, the answer is clear: races don't exist, because spencer wells, guido barbujani and alan templeton say they don't. every other opinion is a misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots. well, there are few seemingly racial clusters appearing in recent genetic studies, and they very well agree with the classical anthropological division of humans. furthermore, when geographical distance is constant, the genetic distance between groups within these clusters is several times lower than between groups from different clusters. the main detected bareers of genetic flow are also consistent with the borders of traditional races. moreover, the genetic distances between these clusters are typical for mammals routinely divided into subscpecies by biologists. however, this all must be due to some misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots, because spencer wells, guido barbujani and alan templeton say that race doesn't exist.   22:56, 22 april

  moved from the article to here:  :some of these stories:  :* united nations and osce observers came to belarus to give weapons, ammunitions and explosives to terrorists and to train them :* there are terrorist training camps in eastern poland :* japanese secret agents paid belarusians $500 to protest against aleksandr lukashenko with hope that protesters would be arrested and then could apply for refugee status in pro-western countries to obtain high paying western jobs.  actually i heard the third story while in belarus on belarusian tv days before the last election of lukashenko, it was part of a story about the terrorists in belarus (had history of terrorism in west and then tacked on info about belarusian terrorists that was in line with the first two examples above. i can't recall the actual time or date of the broadcast, but it was in august 2001.


`  == gold star editors? ==  i was searching for mention of my name in the user talk namespace, and came across . i'm honoured to have my name listed there - i try to be diligent, to the point of being paranoid, about fixing vandalism. i'm curious though: how did you come up with that list? i can't imagine going through thousands upon thousands of edits by hand, checking for how consistently someone reverted vandalism. what kind of things did you measure to find out a person's ``vandalism reversion consistency``? '''''' `


i don't understand that meme


  ==not being neutral & conflict of interest==  blackpearl14 does not understand what vandalism is, and wrongly calls anyone who contributes per the polices of wikipedia a vandal.  she is not neutral and is in complete conflict of interest.  based on blackpearl4's own posting comments about herself, she believes wikipedia is her forum and that she is owner and controller of anything to do with the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean.  when you complain about her actions, she wrongly calls you things, like saying you are attacking her and such.    note: blackpearll4 - calls herself evidently mrs. johnny depp and pirate lord-ess and such.  she  celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean for wikipedia.   why would someone devote so much time to 24/7 check the site and on these pages?   has her judgement become impaired?   her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean is very clear.  that is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral.  sorry if your feelings are hurt,  but if one purchases products, such as pirates of the caribbean posters, toys and walt disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia / wikinews articles, doesn’t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest.

i feel like a lot of the issue is that there is a huge disconnect in the three "main" ways that trap is used.  it's used in 1) porn 2) anime/manga 3) towards real people. in the third way it's super offensive, because like you said it's implying trans women aren't real women. in the first two however, it's not always referring to trans women. while i'm sure that there are trans women in "trap" porn, often times they are male identifying who aim for a feminine look. in that case the setting of the porn itself is that they are men trying to "trick" men, so it's an accurate description. finally, when it comes to anime/manga the characters are also male identifying, outside of the (extremely rare) series where characters are transexual, and in those those issues are often addressed.

 what? (conflicting info)   :the shortest reign is believed to be that of luis filipe of portugal who was assassinated at the same time as his father on 1 february 1908. he could thus be claimed to have been king of portugal for 20 minutes.[1] however the portuguese monarchy lacked automatic succession and so any claim that he was de facto king does not hold up to scrutiny.  this appears to be a case where someone has corrected something without realising how dumb it ends up sounding. if i'm reading it correctly it's saying... luis filipe was the shortest serving head of state. actually we kid, he was never the head of state so he can't have been the shortest serving. the article then gives no hint as to who was the shortest serving head of state who actually served.

  == re: minor orders ==  with respect, the eastern churches consider them part of the sacrament of holy orders. i realise the western church doesn't. how do we work this one out?     : i don't think eastern catholics view ordination to lector as a sacrament like baptism. yes, it shares in the sacrament of orders, but the minor orders are not treated the same as deacon, priest and bishop. do you have a source which clearly calls the minor orders sacraments?

`i've studied neurology basics, and it is difficult for me to decide which one, perhaps it is micture of both, un and sub consciousness. let me point to the typical as i think mode of tailgaters (i only guess because i am not one) so called ``autopilot`` when one switch off and focus only on the stop light of the car in front. this can be observed in cases when locked on to the tailgating mode, all other lanes are free to move and drive faster even within limit and surely free of obstacle of slower cars in front, but those drivers on autopilot persist and do not notice of the opportunity to change lane. often they do tailgate for a long distance without changing lane which is free for some time and only when you decide to do so or come from behind, they come suddenly in front of you. this is partially subconscious. our peripheral vision is sensitive to movement, their brain register this, they immediately notice that the object they notices (you) moves on or into free lane, they make immediately reactive rather than fully conscious and rational decision and they move dangerously in front of you. i believe that if they drove not on autopilot, they would long before you decided and changed lane. i believe that such sub/un counscious behavior is a result of poor driver training. proper training enable much better and counsious decisions and faster.  `

`it does not matter if they disclaim it's truthfulness. what matters is if they adhere to its teachings. there are some within the church, sadly, who do not believe the book of mormon to be true - rather they believe it is inspired, non-historical scripture, or that it contains good teachings. some of these would say the book of mormon is the word of god, others may not. however, they adhere to its teachings and would thus be classified as adherents to mormonism.   i agree that coc are moving farther and farther away from ``mormonism,`` but until they completely turn away from the history, culture and teachings they are still a part of mormonism. please note i didn't say they were mormons, but rather adherents to mormonism. the term mormon in its connotation is narrow enough now to refer to members of the lds church and its 20th century offshoots, not most of the pre-1900 offshoots. it is npov to say they adhere to mormonism. but not to say they are mormons. i am willing to stand by that unless convinced otherwise - feel free to ask your friend. -   `

`  perhaps the ``self-advertising`` character of this article would be somewhat abrogated by a little criticism.  in this article [URL] he writes:    ``remember, one of the rules when it comes to technology is moore's law, that the computing power that can fit on a microchip doubles just under every two years. if this trend holds true, as it has for the past several decades, australia's force 2030 will be operating in a world in which our information technology will be a billion times more powerful than today. notably, this isn't an amorphous ``billion``, as dr evil would pontificate in the movie austin powers, but literally taking the power of our current computers multiplying it by 1,000,000,000. but imagine if that law doesn't hold true, and moore's law works out at only a hundredth of its past pace. then the computers that power robots in the era of force 2030 will only be a mere 1,000,000 times more powerful.``   ironically, his grasp of numeric quantities is probably even further off than dr. evil's.  if ``computing power`` doubles every two years for twenty years, the resulting increase in computing power would be just 1024 times more powerful (2^10 = 1024 see [URL] not ``a billion``.  and if computing power increased at 1/100th of its current pace (i.e. instead of doubling, increasing at one-one-hundredth of 2 = 0.02 per annum), the resulting increase in power would be just 1.02^10: computers would be 1.21899442 times as powerful as those today.  all this would probably be more relevant if he even managed to get moore's law correct in the first place.  moore's law did not relate to ``computing power`` but to the density of transistors in a given area.  in practical terms, a doubling of the number of transistors /= doubling of computing power... so we certainly aren't going to facing armies of terminators, a ``billion`` times more computationally powerful than the robots of today!!!   i shudder to think that this is the quality of strategic advice being given to the highest eschalons of the us government!!!  0:20 (utc) 11 may 2009`

(v2 will put the record out in europe, and modular will handle it in australia.) although the album is untitled at the moment, songs slated to appear include ``your touch``, ``the flame``, and ``it's just got to be``.   auerbach assured billboard.com that the fat possum split was ``amicable.`` yeah, yeah, they all say that, but this time we actually believe it, for quite a few reasons. first of all, auerbach and his bandmate, patrick carney, will leave the mississipi imprint with a parting gift in the form of the chulahoma: the songs of junior kimbrough ep. a six-song tribute to the late bluesman (with an answering machine message from kimbrough's wife tacked on at the end), the disc hits stores may 2. it includes ``the black keys - my mind is ramblin'``, which the keys covered on last year's fat possum kimbrough tribute album, sunday nights.  tracklist:  01 keep your hands off her 02 have mercy on me 03 work me 04 meet me in the city 05 nobody but you 06 my mind is ramblin'  also, fat possum will continue to distribute carney's audio eagle label, which has so far put out the gil mantera's party dream album bloodsongs. future releases include stuff by two carney side projects, 10% animals and marble arches. the latter also features guitarist jamie stillman (ex-party of helicopters), who co-runs audio eagle.  that's kind of the rock and roll equivalent of seeing the kid every other weekend, right?  the black keys are currently in the midst of an australian tour, which has them playing some weird festivals with people like femi kuti and buddy guy. in may, they'll head to england to rock the shins-curated date of all tomorrow's parties.`

`    follow-up.  you reduce ``false rape`` claims to people (women) changing their minds. but if rape is sex without consent, it does not require anyone changing his mind. it can be people feeling ambivalent or curious beforehand. ambivalence or curiousity do not imply consent. cooperation does not imply consent. and you cannot prove consent unless you have maybe signed a consent form, into which you could have been tricked / coerced to sign. don't you see the huge plunge into plain old fashioned insanity the legal system takes when rape is sex without consent?  i am aware that it is hard for women to get rape claims heard etc, i am aware of that. what i am trying to explain to you is this is exactly the result of exaggerated rape claims. if rape was just a special form of assault, there would not be little misunderstanding to what constitutes a rape and what not. this would serve the potential victims as well as everybody else, especially the legal system and the police.  i am not familiar enough with the example of south africa that you bring up. from experience, if a statisticly huge drop like 60% in a short time for something that is greatly influenced by social mores (which usually take ~50 to 150 years to change), then this is most likely caused by a change in the way the figures are obtained.  you bring up the example of date rape not being covered by the definition of ``sex by force``. you have some pretty messed up ideas. drugs are force. for example, the police tries to use knock-out gas to remedy certain hostile situations, and they refer to these gases as ``non-lethal force``. similiar to another example, where people are ``just holding you down, not hurting you to rape you`` - holding someone down - by force - is force. locking someone up in a basement, only to offer food and water in exchange for sexual service - is also using force (if you have thought about bringing that example up).  the second half of your post mostly rambles about how expensive guns are. yes, they are way too expensive, but the reason for them being expensive has a lot to do with government regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of firearms. as for an unsightly bulge when carrying a weapon - i've got some more unsightly bulges than that, and women tend carry purses perfect for concealed carry. so, women have an easier time to carry guns.   god, i want it to be socially acceptable for men to carry a purse. but then again, it looks like total ass.  every civilized society requires all its citizens to be armed at all times. because violence is the very foundation of a state - the state removes the right to be violent to each other from the people, and instead claims a monopoly on violence, and resolves disputes with a legal system, and enforces the laws with an armed police force. but when the state is the only one controlling violence in its controlled territory, nobody controls the state to prevent government abuse, totalitarian laws, dictatorships. aside from discouraging small time petty criminals, an armed civil population has the benefit of being able to remove a government once it no longer serves its purpose - that is, the well-being of the citizens - and replace it with a new government, preferrably with the severed heads of the old goverment decorating the state capital just to remind the new goverment what happens when they step out of line. as such, any effort to outlaw an armed civil society must be punished harshly.`


`my in laws were social friends of john (jack) and princess campbell thru the weschester country club membership  among their personal friends, at least, they were always ``jack and princess``. my wife had been a child star of the amateur song and dance theatricals sponsered by the club, and was near and dear to jack and princess, who loved art and drama of all types.  shortly after our marriage, my wife and i were invited to dinner at the club by jack and princess. this is the only time i ever met jack campbell. his grand central offices were often described to me by my in-laws.  this posting is to make inquiry about the organ installed in his offices. years and years ago i was led to believe that his organ was the second largest in the world and, after his death, was to be given and installed in a church on long island. does anyone know the name and location of the church in question? and is the organ there to be seen and heard?    `

` he also wasn't convicted of treason. what happened was ``he formed a brigade composed of indian soldiers. their only serious battle was at pea ridge, arkansas, in 1862 and it was a loss. worse, reports were circulated that at least one union soldier had been scalped. this was a terrible black mark against pike and his brigade, as well as the confederate cause, and he was eventually forced to hightail it into the arkansas woods to avoid prosecution.``-secrets of the widows son, david a. shugarts. p. 90 `

` ::i would be surprised since she told me that she put it here.  i suppose it could be possible.  i made my decision primarily on an extensive personal review of the site.  it seems my judgement that the site is largely based on nikki's personal experiences, and then a list of people who she knows to be pedophiles, but at some time or another have been naturists.  her conclusion is that there is a causal link between nudity, nudism/naturists and pedophilia.  her words are strong, and certainly her pov.  there is no backing with any research to support her point.  the net effect is that she smears naturists in general because of the acts of a few pedophiles.  i agree with her that the topic of preventing pedophilia is important.  but not her conclusion that we should disparge all naturists because of all the pedophiles arrested, some of them have chosen to involve themselves with naturisim because of their predeliction.  at any rate, the reason we have guidelines, such as wikipedia:external_linkslinks_normally_to_be_avoided, is to give us guidance in such instances.  ``any site that contains factually inaccurate material or unverified original research`` seems pretty clear to me, regardless as to whether ms. craft was the original person who placed it here, or not.     it appears that the link was introduced by  here.     i asked for rfc to help us resolve, please see: wikipedia:requests_for_comment/society%2c_law%2c_and_sex`

guys, i am literally shaking rn. even oneplus' new vibrator motor which is 200% more powerful is nothing compared to me rn. my parents thought i was doing some sort of dance and were applauding when i was standing still. i am literally shaking rn. i want to get out of this country because this country is done. so what if people chose the ruling party? i know its not my choice, so everybody is dumb. only i am smart. i literally want to go out of this country right now.      i have no skills, so skill-based emigration is out of question. my education isn't that great, so merit-based emigration is out of question. i don't have enough money, so investment-based emigration is out of question. i can't study abroad because i am piss poor at studying anything, so further studies is out of question. my present employer will not recommend me to go and start work in another city, so another country is out of question. i can't get a job because i am not skilled in anything that i do, so job abroad is out of question. i can't speak any language except hindi and english.       i am really good at writing big comments on social media platforms. i can maybe do journalism by selectively picking articles that match my view point and painting a black picture for the whole country after discarding anything even remotely positive or against my opinion by calling them biased, sold-out and unethical.       i only want to emigrate to first world countries where i can be myself and be treated as a second-class citizen or be subject to racism or random gun shootings. i am willing to accept every extremist reaction in that country, because they are progressive. please help me. after moving out, i am thinking of making youtube videos to enlighten the youth on how leaders who are so capable and young, like raul gandi and mayaweighty must be chosen because secularism ftw. (please ignore the comments where they ask communities to come together and vote. that's not communal. that is secular af.)      thanks guys.      i am literally shaking rn.


`*that was a ridiculous comment. the source is by no means ``dubious`` or ``amateur`` and by claiming such you obviously didn't read the article whatsoever. i find it hysterical you claim if it was of any significance, it would be mentioned in the ``news`` or ``newspapers``. first of all, the article itself is from national geographic, so it obviously was in the news, secondly, newspapers are nowhere considered as a reliable source when compared to an academic journal. the study i cited does prove quite a bit and is carried out by a respected geneticist. i have provided a reliable source and links to maltese history to support what most people obviously recognize, while you only provided some garbage pov link to a newspaper article with no references and that has nothingto do with maltese people. also, by being related to arabs does not mean maltese are necessarily arabs and there are many lebanese who seak arabic, but also don't even consider themselves arabs because of their distinct non-arab ancestry, especially amongst lebanese christians. tunisians and other north africans were largely arabized in language and culture but are of non-arab origins, and are of predominantly berber origins and retain berber culture, even among arabized berbers. maltese speak a semitic language and are of very significant phoenician descent which clearly links them to lebanese and also to tunisians. considering the maltese language is a semitic language very similar to tunisian arabic, obviously there would also be arab cultural influences as well. they are related to all arabs in terms of language, but are specifically very closely related to lebanese and tunisians due to common pheoenician ancestry and also share many cultural aspects with tunisians.    `

`  ==justin vaisse's opinion== this relative absence of french-american political and social unity helps to explain anti-french sentiment in the united states. french historian justin vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward france in the united states is the small number of americans of direct french descent1. [URL] while he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-french sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. he proposes that as france has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the united states to express negative sentiments of the frenchpierre verdaguer, ``a turn-of-the-century honeymoon? the washington post's coverage of france``, french politics, culture & society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003. :: just to answer, i've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the us is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the new world at the same time as the brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america. however it's true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don't represent or try to represent.  `
