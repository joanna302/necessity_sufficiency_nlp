We were two peas in a pod and loved being around eachother. Well fast forward a few years we started being intimate. Our family eventually found out and she left me and I left home. Now 10 years later she reached out to me out of the blue and we started talking. Side note, 2018 as a whole was the worst year of my life. When I say the whole year, every month, every day was emotionally and physically taxing to a degree where my hair is literally thining and  falling out I mean it(my hair used to be thick and healthy).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So we start talking and it feels as though no time has passed at all. Its great! I cant believe she is talking to me again. But in my gut I know its just a rebound text(my mom told me she recent broke up with a 2yr relationship). Well she isnt doing to well either and she tries to kill herself so I call out of work for a whole week and I am across the whole country the next day to see her in the hospital. She is finally released and we have an amazing week together! Doing everything, always laughing and just enjoying eachothers company. But theres an issue, she constantly lied to me, about stupid stuff. She is a terrible liar but I never called her out. Even her mom told me she was sleeping with multiple people and when I asked she lied about her previous relationship even though she brought that up. There were so many red flags that I ignored, so many times she made herself to he victim to everything and I knew was trying to get me to feel sorry for her, and I ignored them all because I wanted to support her. On the last night we are snuggled up in her bed as we did everynight and she keeps pulling me on top of her to just \"get closer\" as she says (yeah okay). We start kissing and I ask over and over if its what she wants (i dont want to have sex but i wanted her to be happy and she seemed to really want to) and you can guess what happened. Well I drive home that night and cry all the way home because I know I was just used.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Over the next couple weeks she slowly talks to me less and less and barely wants to see me after I move back home after almost 10 years away. I finally call her and confront her and she tells me nothing has changed and hasnt talked to me since.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am so disgusted with myself for being so easy and ignoring all the signs that she was manipualting me. I cant even look at her because she isnt even the same person she used to be and it hurts so much. Not a single apology or an attempt to say anything from her. I dont know why she used me and I am so broken up about it. I told her all the shit that went down even about me losing my daughter that year (2018) and she still did this. Idk what to do. I want peace but she wont talk to me anymore.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] P.S. There were so many more flags and signs i ignored from family and friends but this post is long enough. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR:  My best friend/sweet heart from child hood called me up after 10 years. She was struggling so I went to help her out. My time with her was great but there were alot of red flags I ignored. I didnt want to sleep with her but she kept pushing so I did then she started to distance herself from me. I feel so used and disgusted with myself and I dont know why she did it.</td>\n",

Ronda Rousey is helping set up a suicide prevention center or something.  Something like that.  As I read through the article, I came to learn that her father and grandfather committed suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I appreciate the kind thought and I don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How stupid do you think I am?  Do you think I don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  Do you think that I'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'? [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide.  I don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when I am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why is it that when I get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is \"Get help.\"?  What do you think this help is going to give me that I haven't already experienced?  It'll give me more goddamn bills and I'll get somebody on the phone asking me if I want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I know how to fight this.  The reason that I'm sitting here typing this is all the proof I need. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I see these anti-suicide things, I just feel so irked.  The only time you give a fuck about me is when I'm in a suicidal mindset.  Beside that, I'm just a blank face.  A mere statistic. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Believe me.  Seriously.  Believe me.  I'm not yanking your chain.  I know how bad suicide is.  You don't need to remind me of that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't stop you from trying to prevent suicide, but I can state my opinion and so, I have. [linebreak]  [linebreak]</td>\n",

I don't even know what to think, feel, say, do. I've worked for this company for over a year and I got a promotion a few months back and for the first time in a long time i was feeling amazing, not just with my job, but my mental health was the best it has been in a long time and for it to just.. disappear and get that rug pulled from under me so suddenly is just... i dont know. The only word that explains what i feel this exact second is just \"Numbing\". I just feel numb with this whole situation. I already cried, felt sorry for myself, vented with my SO. Now I got home, and im just sitting in my couch writing this and I just feel. Numb. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sorry for the grammar. Im not thinking, just, venting it out to get it out of my system.   \n",
       "1  My best friend, who I grew up with and had a HUGE crush on, and I began talking again after almost 10 years. Back in the day it was the fantasy childhood sweet hearts. We were two peas in a pod and loved being around eachother. Well fast forward a few years we started being intimate. Our family eventually found out and she left me and I left home. Now 10 years later she reached out to me out of the blue and we started talking. Side note, 2018 as a whole was the worst year of my life. When I say the whole year, every month, every day was emotionally and physically taxing to a degree where my hair is literally thining and  falling out I mean it(my hair used to be thick and healthy).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So we start talking and it feels as though no time has passed at all. Its great! I cant believe she is talking to me again. But in my gut I know its just a rebound text(my mom told me she recent broke up with a 2yr relationship). Well she isnt doing to well either and she tries to kill herself so I call out of work for a whole week and I am across the whole country the next day to see her in the hospital. She is finally released and we have an amazing week together! Doing everything, always laughing and just enjoying eachothers company. But theres an issue, she constantly lied to me, about stupid stuff. She is a terrible liar but I never called her out. Even her mom told me she was sleeping with multiple people and when I asked she lied about her previous relationship even though she brought that up. There were so many red flags that I ignored, so many times she made herself to he victim to everything and I knew was trying to get me to feel sorry for her, and I ignored them all because I wanted to support her. On the last night we are snuggled up in her bed as we did everynight and she keeps pulling me on top of her to just \"get closer\" as she says (yeah okay). We start kissing and I ask over and over if its what she wants (i dont want to have sex but i wanted her to be happy and she seemed to really want to) and you can guess what happened. Well I drive home that night and cry all the way home because I know I was just used.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Over the next couple weeks she slowly talks to me less and less and barely wants to see me after I move back home after almost 10 years away. I finally call her and confront her and she tells me nothing has changed and hasnt talked to me since.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am so disgusted with myself for being so easy and ignoring all the signs that she was manipualting me. I cant even look at her because she isnt even the same person she used to be and it hurts so much. Not a single apology or an attempt to say anything from her. I dont know why she used me and I am so broken up about it. I told her all the shit that went down even about me losing my daughter that year (2018) and she still did this. Idk what to do. I want peace but she wont talk to me anymore.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] P.S. There were so many more flags and signs i ignored from family and friends but this post is long enough. [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR:  My best friend/sweet heart from child hood called me up after 10 years. She was struggling so I went to help her out. My time with her was great but there were alot of red flags I ignored. I didnt want to sleep with her but she kept pushing so I did then she started to distance herself from me. I feel so used and disgusted with myself and I dont know why she did it.   \n",

I suppose that would hinge on your definition of terrible.  At any rate, I happened upon an article.  Ronda Rousey is helping set up a suicide prevention center or something.  Something like that.  As I read through the article, I came to learn that her father and grandfather committed suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I appreciate the kind thought and I don't believe you meant to get me going, but you got me going. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How stupid do you think I am?  Do you think I don't fucking realize how goddamn horrible suicide is?  Do you think that I'm some naive apelike simpleton that needs to be sent to a mental hospital for therapy, medication and other costly 'treatments'? [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's nice to know that you care about other suicidal people, but for me, I don't take too kindly to being told that I don't have the right to commit suicide.  I don't take kindly to platitudes and appeals to my emotions when I am already fully cognizant of the horrors of suicide. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Why is it that when I get to be a little too lonely and desperate, the *first* thing you're going to tell me is \"Get help.\"?  What do you think this help is going to give me that I haven't already experienced?  It'll give me more goddamn bills and I'll get somebody on the phone asking me if I want to sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I know how to fight this.  The reason that I'm sitting here typing this is all the proof I need. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When I see these anti-suicide things, I just feel so irked.  The only time you give a fuck about me is when I'm in a suicidal mindset.  Beside that, I'm just a blank face.  A mere statistic. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Believe me.  Seriously.  Believe me.  I'm not yanking your chain.  I know how bad suicide is.  You don't need to remind me of that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I can't stop you from trying to prevent suicide, but I can state my opinion and so, I have. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   \n",

Devotchka  I once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages.  (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?) -) :Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.)  SJK  Vietnamese has more syllable-final consonants than Japanese, I think you can tell them apart that way, maybe. Is this right? - Juuitchan  Someone suggested: ``Heath Robinson`` and ``Rube Goldberg`` as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, ``Rube Goldberg`` is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDC  As an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.  :I think Americans certainly understand the use of ``bum`` for ``butt``, ``rubbish`` for ``trash``, and (to a lesser degree) ``flat`` for ``apartment``.  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say ``that's a trash can``; a Brit will say ``that's a rubbish bin``.  Americans are more likely to use ``rubbish`` in the sense of ``bullshit``. LDC  I deleted the following pair: ``limited (Ltd)`` and ``incorporated``, since they actually mean different things. ``Incorporated`` means a corporation; ``limited`` means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  SJK  I would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.  Yes, I'd call it a ``torch``, and it would probably be labeled as a ``flashlight`` in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  The Anome  Oh, so ``flashlight`` is correct British usage? (My dictionary said [Am.] and the Oxford English Dictionary carried ``flashlight`` only in the meaning of photography.) Then I'll remove the entry again. AxelBoldt `</td>\n",

The theory behind adult time-outs is that you deprive the child of your attention. Of course, in our electronic gadget society where children hardly ever see their parents anyways, that accomplishes nothing. So as a replacement for spending time with one's child and paying attention to them most of the time, someone invented the ``child time-out`` as a form of punishment instead. This is not an acceptable trade-off and that's why child time-outs are bad. They're still better than physical abuse of course.  Ark`</td>\n",

       "3   `This is such a fun entry.   Devotchka  I once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages.  (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?) -) :Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.)  SJK  Vietnamese has more syllable-final consonants than Japanese, I think you can tell them apart that way, maybe. Is this right? - Juuitchan  Someone suggested: ``Heath Robinson`` and ``Rube Goldberg`` as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, ``Rube Goldberg`` is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDC  As an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.  :I think Americans certainly understand the use of ``bum`` for ``butt``, ``rubbish`` for ``trash``, and (to a lesser degree) ``flat`` for ``apartment``.  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say ``that's a trash can``; a Brit will say ``that's a rubbish bin``.  Americans are more likely to use ``rubbish`` in the sense of ``bullshit``. LDC  I deleted the following pair: ``limited (Ltd)`` and ``incorporated``, since they actually mean different things. ``Incorporated`` means a corporation; ``limited`` means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  SJK  I would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.  Yes, I'd call it a ``torch``, and it would probably be labeled as a ``flashlight`` in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  The Anome  Oh, so ``flashlight`` is correct British usage? (My dictionary said [Am.] and the Oxford English Dictionary carried ``flashlight`` only in the meaning of photography.) Then I'll remove the entry again. AxelBoldt `   \n",

They are the real problem in a confrontation. It's rare that children need to ``cool off``.  The theory behind adult time-outs is that you deprive the child of your attention. Of course, in our electronic gadget society where children hardly ever see their parents anyways, that accomplishes nothing. So as a replacement for spending time with one's child and paying attention to them most of the time, someone invented the ``child time-out`` as a form of punishment instead. This is not an acceptable trade-off and that's why child time-outs are bad. They're still better than physical abuse of course.  Ark`   \n",

[...] assuming this sample is roughly representative of adult female u.s. crania, oprah\\'s head perimeter is 6.3 sd above the mean of american women.      [*\"independent confirmation of oprah\\'s head size\"*]([URL]     >the late gene siskel went hat shopping with oprah and the salesman said oprah\\'s was the largest head he\\'d ever seen. using the late j.p. rushton\\'s idea of using the formula for calculating the volume of a hemisphere (v = circumfence\\\\^3 / 118.4) oprah would have a cranial capacity of 2229\\xa0cm\\\\^3...

[*\"iq & fighting back against racism\"*]([URL]     >oprah\\'s 2029 cc cranial capacity gave her the iq to handle racists with style. when a skinhead called her a monkey and then tried to change the subject, oprah grabbed him by the arm and said \\'\"i want to talk about the *monkey business*\". this showed lateral thinking because they were literally talking about monkeys...

[*\"big brained oprah tried to stop the war with iraq\"*]([URL]     >while no human in history has had a deviation iq much beyond 200, oprah\\'s 2,029 cc estimated brain size is arguably around what you would statistically expect from a 400 iq being, and so was the wisdom she displayed in the run-up to the war in iraq.
